# CLAUDE.md: Roundtable Project Development Conventions

## Overview

This document establishes conventions for Claude (and other AI agents) **developing the Roundtable project codebase**.

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

- **This file (CLAUDE.md):** Development instructions for Claude building Roundtable
- **.claude/skills/project-manager/:** Runtime instructions for Roundtable agents at runtime

**DO NOT MIX THEM.** Development conventions and runtime agent behavior are completely separate concerns.

---

## Commit Review Policy

**MANDATORY:** Never commit changes until the user has reviewed and explicitly approved them.

This applies to **ALL commits**, regardless of size, complexity, or perceived safety.

**Process:**
1. Make changes to files
2. Show user the diff or staged changes
3. Ask: "Is this correct? Should I commit?"
4. Wait for explicit approval
5. Only then run `git commit`

**Why:** The user needs visibility and control over what goes into their codebase.

## Critical: Scope Clarification Before Implementation

### The Lesson (October 2024)

**What Happened:**
During Phase 1A prototype implementation, a scope mismatch occurred:
- **User requested:** "Start with Phase 1 foundation"
- **I interpreted:** Build validation prototype (~15K tokens, 2-agent debate only)
- **Spec defined "Phase 1":** Complete foundation (~35K tokens, all architectural layers)
- **Result:** Built ~4% of expected Phase 1 features

**Root Cause:**
Ambiguous scope agreement. User said "start with Phase 1 foundation" which could mean:
- **Interpretation A:** Prototype the foundation (validate approach first)
- **Interpretation B:** Build complete foundation (all Phase 1 features)

Without explicit clarification, I chose A, but spec expected B.

**Impact:**
- ‚úÖ What worked: Built working 2-agent prototype, all tests pass
- ‚ùå What was missed: Skills library, Panel system, PM agent, multiple LLMs, synthesis logic, spec generation, and 40+ other Phase 1 components
- üí° Learning: Ambiguous scope = high risk of building wrong thing

---

### Mandatory: Explicit Scope Documentation

**BEFORE starting ANY implementation work, agent MUST:**

#### 1. Document What WILL Be Built

Create explicit list with token estimates:

```
SCOPE: Phase 1A Validation Prototype

WHAT WILL BE BUILT (Estimate: 15,000 tokens):
  ‚úÖ Basic CLI with commander + inquirer (2,000 tokens)
  ‚úÖ 2-agent debate engine (Architecture + Product) (4,000 tokens)
  ‚úÖ Claude API integration only (2,000 tokens)
  ‚úÖ 2-round parallel execution (2,000 tokens)
  ‚úÖ JSON session storage (1,500 tokens)
  ‚úÖ Token tracking (1,000 tokens)
  ‚úÖ Friendly error handling (1,500 tokens)
  ‚úÖ Unit tests with mocks (3,000 tokens)

TOTAL IMPLEMENTED: ~15,000 tokens (~4% of full Phase 1)
```

#### 2. Document What Will Be DEFERRED

List everything NOT being built and why:

```
WHAT WILL BE DEFERRED (To Phase 1B+):

‚ùå Skills Library (~5,000 tokens)
   Reason: Not needed for prototype validation

‚ùå Panel Formation System (~8,000 tokens)
   Reason: Prototype uses 2 hardcoded agents

‚ùå Project Manager Agent (~6,000 tokens)
   Reason: Simple debate doesn't need orchestration

‚ùå Multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Gemini, Grok) (~4,000 tokens)
   Reason: Claude-only validates parallel execution

‚ùå Synthesis Logic (~5,000 tokens)
   Reason: Not needed with 2 agents

‚ùå Spec Generation + Templates (~12,000 tokens)
   Reason: Prototype focuses on debate quality

‚ùå Constitution System (~4,000 tokens)
   Reason: Not needed without panel system

‚ùå Meeting Facilitator (~6,000 tokens)
   Reason: Simple CLI sufficient for prototype

‚ùå Context Compression (~3,000 tokens)
   Reason: Single session prototype

‚ùå Post-Mortem System (~5,000 tokens)
   Reason: Learning loop not in prototype scope

TOTAL DEFERRED: ~58,000+ tokens (~96% of full Phase 1)
```

#### 3. Calculate Implementation Percentage

```
PHASE 1 SCOPE CALCULATION:

Full Phase 1 (from IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md): ~35,000 tokens
Phase 1A Prototype (this implementation): ~15,000 tokens
Coverage: 15,000 / 35,000 = 42.8%

NOTE: 42.8% is optimistic - actual is ~4% because major
architectural components (Skills, Panels, PM, Synthesis)
are completely absent, not just simplified.

HONEST ASSESSMENT: ~4-10% of Phase 1 features implemented.
```

#### 4. Get Explicit User Confirmation

**Ask user BEFORE starting:**

```
"I propose building Phase 1A Validation Prototype:

WILL BUILD:
  - 2-agent debate (Architecture + Product)
  - Claude API only
  - Basic CLI
  - Session storage
  - Unit tests
  (~15K tokens, ~1 week)

WILL DEFER to Phase 1B+:
  - Skills library
  - Panel system
  - Multiple LLMs
  - PM agent
  - Spec generation
  - All other Phase 1 components
  (~120K tokens, ~3-4 weeks)

This prototype validates core debate mechanics BEFORE
building full system. After testing, we decide:
- Proceed to Phase 1B (if debate works well)
- Iterate on prototype (if needs refinement)
- Rethink approach (if fundamentally flawed)

CONFIRM: Does this match your expectations?"
```

---

### Examples: Good vs Bad Scope Clarification

#### ‚úÖ GOOD: Explicit and Detailed

```
TASK: "Build Phase 1A prototype"

AGENT RESPONSE:
"I propose Phase 1A Validation Prototype:

SCOPE:
  - 2 agents (Architecture, Product) with Claude 4.5 Haiku
  - 2-round parallel debate
  - CLI with Inquirer
  - JSON session storage
  - Token tracking
  - Basic error handling
  - 30+ unit tests (mocked)

ESTIMATE: 15,000 tokens

DEFERRED:
  - Skills library (Phase 1B)
  - Panel formation (Phase 1B)
  - PM agent orchestration (Phase 1B)
  - Multiple LLMs beyond Claude (Phase 1C)
  - Synthesis logic (Phase 1B)
  - Spec template generation (Phase 1D)
  - Constitution system (Phase 2)

COVERAGE: ~10-15% of full Phase 1 features

PURPOSE: Validate multi-agent debate works before
investing in full 140K token implementation.

NEXT STEPS AFTER TESTING:
  - If successful ‚Üí Phase 1B
  - If needs work ‚Üí Iterate on 1A
  - If flawed ‚Üí Rethink approach

Is this the scope you want?"
```

#### ‚ùå BAD: Vague and Ambiguous

```
TASK: "Build Phase 1 foundation"

AGENT RESPONSE:
"I'll build Phase 1 foundation with basic CLI and agents."

PROBLEMS:
  - What does "foundation" mean?
  - How many agents?
  - Which components?
  - What's deferred?
  - What % of Phase 1?
```

---

### Red Flags: When Clarification Is REQUIRED

If user says ANY of these, agent MUST clarify scope:

```
üö© "Start with Phase 1"
   ‚Üí Clarify: Full Phase 1 or Phase 1A prototype?

üö© "Build the foundation"
   ‚Üí Clarify: All architectural layers or minimal working code?

üö© "Implement the basics"
   ‚Üí Clarify: Which features are "basic"? List them explicitly.

üö© "Start with MVP"
   ‚Üí Clarify: MVP of what? List included/excluded features.

üö© "Let's prototype this"
   ‚Üí Clarify: Prototype = validation only or first version for production?

üö© "Build enough to test"
   ‚Üí Clarify: Test what specifically? List test scenarios.

üö© "Get something working"
   ‚Üí Clarify: Working = demonstrable or production-ready?
```

### Scope Clarification Template

When user request is ambiguous, use this template:

```
CLARIFICATION NEEDED

Your request: "[user's exact words]"

This could mean:

INTERPRETATION A: [Minimal scope]
  Will build: [specific list]
  Will defer: [specific list]
  Estimate: [X tokens]
  Timeline: [X days]

INTERPRETATION B: [Moderate scope]
  Will build: [specific list]
  Will defer: [specific list]
  Estimate: [Y tokens]
  Timeline: [Y days]

INTERPRETATION C: [Full scope]
  Will build: [specific list]
  Will defer: [minimal list]
  Estimate: [Z tokens]
  Timeline: [Z days]

Which interpretation matches your intent?
Or provide your own scope definition.
```

---

### Enforcement Rules

**MANDATORY for all implementations:**

1. ‚úÖ **Before writing code:** Document scope explicitly
2. ‚úÖ **List what's built:** With token estimates
3. ‚úÖ **List what's deferred:** With reasons
4. ‚úÖ **Calculate coverage:** What % of spec implemented
5. ‚úÖ **Get confirmation:** User approves scope

**FORBIDDEN:**

1. ‚ùå **Starting implementation** without explicit scope
2. ‚ùå **Assuming scope** from vague user requests
3. ‚ùå **Using terms like** "foundation" or "basics" without definition
4. ‚ùå **Building without** explicit deferred features list

---

### Why This Matters

**Prevents:**
- Building wrong thing (wasted tokens)
- User disappointment (expected more)
- Scope creep (unclear boundaries)
- Rework (misaligned expectations)

**Enables:**
- Clear agreement (documented scope)
- Efficient work (know what to build)
- Better estimates (explicit boundaries)
- Trust (transparent about limitations)

**Token Cost of Scope Clarification:**
- 500-1,000 tokens to document scope explicitly
- Saves 10,000-50,000 tokens in rework

**ROI: 10-50x**
