# Phased Development: From Vision to Reality

## Overview

Roundtable enables two distinct paths from vision to implementation:

1. **Single-Pass (All-In):** Create complete spec in one or multiple sessions
2. **Phased (Iterative):** Break vision into phases, MVP each, get feedback, refine

This document explains the phased approach and how it enables faster, more validated product development.

---

## The Core Decision: Vision Scope

### At the Beginning

User chooses their approach:

```
Choice 1: SINGLE-PASS (All-In)
  Granular vision → One/multiple roundtable sessions →
  Complete spec → Implementation → Testing → Done

Choice 2: PHASED (Iterative)
  High-level vision → Break into phases →
  Phase 1 session → Phase 1 spec → Implementation →
  Testing → Feedback → Phase 2 session → ...
```

**Decision Framework:**

```
Choose SINGLE-PASS if:
  - You have complete vision (all features clear)
  - Timeline allows longer implementation before feedback
  - Features are independent (no build-on-each-other)
  - You're confident in initial assumptions

Choose PHASED if:
  - Vision is broad but details unclear
  - You want to validate with real implementation early
  - Features build on each other (each phase is foundation)
  - You want to incorporate user feedback incrementally
  - You want to optimize based on Phase 1 learning
  - Budget/timeline constraints (ship Phase 1 first)
```

## Phase Structure

### What Defines a Phase?

Each phase must have:

1. **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
   - Smallest complete, usable thing
   - Could be shipped and used
   - Forms foundation for next phase

2. **POC (Proof of Concept)**
   - What makes THIS phase stand out?
   - What assumption is validated?
   - What technical innovation is tested?

3. **Constraints**
   - What's explicitly NOT in this phase
   - What assumptions are deferred
   - What future phases will handle

### Example: SaaS Task Management

**Phase 1: Individual Task Management**
```
MVP: User can create, organize, and track tasks
POC: Offline-first sync that preserves user work
Constraints:
  - Single user only (team coming in Phase 2)
  - No sharing or comments (Phase 3)
  - No mobile (Phase 2)
```

**Phase 2: Team Collaboration**
```
MVP: Users can share tasks with teammates
POC: Real-time team updates without conflicts
Constraints:
  - No permissions model (Phase 3)
  - No audit logging (Phase 4)
```

**Phase 3: Enterprise**
```
MVP: Permission-based access control
POC: Enterprise-grade compliance and audit
Constraints:
  - No SSO (Phase 4)
  - No advanced reporting (Phase 5)
```

## Phase Planning Session

### Before First Roundtable

User or team answers:

```
PHASE PLANNING QUESTIONS

1. VISION SCOPE
   - What's the complete end vision?
   - What's the absolute MVP?
   - What would be nice-to-have?

2. BREAK INTO PHASES
   - How many phases? (typical: 2-5)
   - What's core to Phase 1? (foundation)
   - What can wait until Phase 2+?

3. PHASE 1 SPECIFICALLY
   - What's the minimum users need?
   - What assumption do we validate?
   - What's the POC (standout feature)?
   - What's explicitly NOT in Phase 1?

4. SUCCESS CRITERIA
   - How do we know Phase 1 succeeded?
   - What metrics matter?
   - What feedback would confirm/reject direction?

5. TIMELINE
   - How long to implement Phase 1?
   - When do we want Phase 2 ready?
   - Do we release Phase 1 or iterate first?
```

### Example Planning

```
FOUNDER: "I want to build a note-taking app for teams"

PHASE PLANNING:

1. Complete Vision
   - Individual note creation/editing (foundation)
   - Real-time team collaboration (Phase 2)
   - Rich media embedding (Phase 3)
   - Team knowledge graph (Phase 4)

2. Phase Breakdown
   Phase 1: Single-user note app with offline sync
   Phase 2: Realtime team collaboration
   Phase 3: Rich media and embedding
   Phase 4: Advanced search and knowledge graph

3. Phase 1 Details
   MVP: Create, edit, organize, search notes
   POC: Offline-first sync that never loses work
   NOT in Phase 1: Team features, sharing, real-time

4. Success Criteria
   - Users love the offline experience
   - Sync is reliable and transparent
   - App feels fast and responsive

5. Timeline
   - Phase 1 implementation: 4 weeks
   - Phase 2 ready: 8 weeks
```

## Phase 1 Roundtable Session

### Input to Session

```yaml
session_context:
  type: phased
  phase: 1
  total_phases: 3
  phase_definition:
    mvp: "Single-user note creation, editing, organizing"
    poc: "Offline-first sync that preserves work"
    not_in_phase: "Team collaboration, sharing, rich media"

  user_interaction_level: active
  # User likely more involved in Phase 1

  compressed_context: null
  # First phase has no previous context
```

### Session Execution

Project Manager understands:
- This is Phase 1 of a larger vision
- Focus ruthlessly on Phase 1 MVP + POC
- Don't let ambitious Phase 2+ features creep in

```
PM: "I understand you want to build a note app for teams.
     Today we're focusing ONLY on Phase 1: Single-user
     offline-first note app. We'll bring in team features
     in Phase 2.

     Is that right?"

User: "Yes, exactly. Get the foundation right first."

PM: "Great. Let's build a spec for Phase 1 that's
     detailed enough to implement."
```

### Output: Phase 1 Specification Package

Complete spec including:

```
PHASE 1 SPECIFICATION PACKAGE

1. REQUIREMENTS
   - Create notes (title, content)
   - Organize (notebooks, tags)
   - Search notes
   - Offline access and sync

2. ARCHITECTURE
   - Local SQLite for offline storage
   - Cloud sync via REST API
   - Conflict resolution via CRDTs
   - Authentication with OAuth

3. USER EXPERIENCE
   - Create note flow
   - Offline indicator
   - Sync status feedback
   - Search results presentation

4. CONSTRAINTS & TRADEOFFS
   - Can't search while offline (Phase 2)
   - No sharing (Phase 2)
   - No real-time sync (Phase 2)
   - Single-user only (Phase 2)

5. TECHNICAL DECISIONS
   - Why CRDT for sync
   - Why local-first
   - Why OAuth auth

6. IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
   - Week 1: Auth + note creation
   - Week 2: Organizing, sync
   - Week 3: Search, offline
   - Week 4: Polish, testing
```

---

## Implementation Phase

### Developer Agents Receive Spec

Spec package is handed to developer agents:

```
Developers receive:
  ✓ Complete Phase 1 spec
  ✓ Architecture decisions made
  ✓ UX patterns documented
  ✓ Technical constraints clear
  ✓ What's explicitly NOT in scope
```

Developers implement Phase 1 with clarity:
- No ambiguity (spec created through deliberation)
- No feature creep (scope is bounded)
- No architectural confusion (decided upfront)

### Implementation Output

After 4-6 weeks:

```
PHASE 1 DELIVERABLES
  ✓ Working note app
  ✓ Offline-first functionality
  ✓ Sync system
  ✓ OAuth authentication
  ✓ Basic search
  ✓ Test coverage
```

---

## QA & Feedback Collection

### QA Testing Phase

QA (human or agent) tests Phase 1 against spec:

```
QA FEEDBACK COLLECTION

WHAT WORKED
  - Offline sync was reliable and transparent
  - Note creation flow felt natural
  - Search worked well
  - Performance was excellent

WHAT DIDN'T WORK
  - Conflict resolution UI was confusing
  - Sync status indicator too subtle
  - Search didn't handle special characters

USER EXPERIENCE INSIGHTS
  - Users wanted to sync manually (not automatic)
  - Users wanted to see sync history
  - Users expected tags to auto-complete

TECHNICAL OBSERVATIONS
  - CRDT implementation was solid
  - SQLite performed well at scale
  - Some edge cases in conflict resolution

SUGGESTIONS FOR NEXT PHASE
  - Consider showing merge conflicts more explicitly
  - Manual sync control for more advanced users
  - Pre-Phase 2: Consider schema for team readiness
```

### Feedback Package Structure

```yaml
feedback_package:
  phase: 1

        - "Ready for team features"
      requires: "Conflict UI improvements"
```

---

## Decision Point: Refine or Proceed?

### After QA Feedback

User and team decide:

```
DECISION: What's next?

OPTION A: REFINE PHASE 1
  If: Critical feedback suggests Phase 1 needs work
  Action: Second roundtable session with feedback context
  Output: Phase 1 refinement spec
  Timeline: 1-2 week development
  Then: Back to QA, then either Option A again or Option B

OPTION B: PROCEED TO PHASE 2
  If: Phase 1 is good enough
  Action: Phase 2 roundtable session (with Phase 1 context)
  Output: Phase 2 spec building on Phase 1
  Timeline: Full Phase 2 development
  Benefits: Build on validated foundation
```

### Example Decision

```
USER REVIEW OF FEEDBACK:

"The spec was great. Implementation is solid.

 The conflict resolution UI is confusing for power users,
 but it works for the MVP. I'd rather ship Phase 1 and
 iterate based on real user feedback.

 Let's proceed to Phase 2 for team collaboration.
 We can refine conflict resolution based on how real
 users interact with Phase 1."

DECISION: Proceed to Phase 2 (with Phase 1 refinement noted for later)
```

---

## Phase 2+ Roundtable Sessions

### Input: Compressed Phase 1 Context

When starting Phase 2, previous phase context is compressed:

```yaml
session_context:
  type: phased
  phase: 2
  total_phases: 3

  compressed_previous_context: |
    PHASE 1 SUMMARY (Compressed from full Phase 1 session):

    WHAT WE LEARNED:
    - Offline-first architecture is working well
    - CRDT sync is reliable
    - Users appreciated manual sync control (not automatic)
    - Conflict resolution UI needs clarity but MVP works
    - Single-user foundation is solid

    PHASE 1 DELIVERABLES:
    - Working note app with offline sync
    - OAuth authentication
    - Search functionality
    - CRDT-based sync

    ARCHITECTURE VALIDATED:
    - SQLite local storage
    - REST API sync
    - CRDT conflict resolution
    - This architecture supports Phase 2 team features

    SCHEMA READY FOR TEAMS:
    - Minor adjustments made during Phase 1 for team context
    - Authentication foundation supports team context
    - Sync system can handle shared notes

    ISSUES TO REVISIT IN FUTURE:
    - Conflict UI could be clearer
    - Consider advanced search for Phase 3

  phase_2_definition:
    mvp: "Multiple users can share and edit notes together"
    poc: "Real-time collaboration without conflicts"
    not_in_phase: "Permissions model, advanced search, rich media"
```

### Phase 2 Session

Project Manager starts with context:

```
PM: "Welcome back! We have a working Phase 1 app with
     offline sync. Users are happy with the foundation.

     Today we're building Phase 2: Real-time team
     collaboration. We're adding multiple users, sharing,
     and real-time updates.

     Our architecture from Phase 1 supports this.
     We validated the sync system.
     Now we need to extend for teams.

     Questions on Phase 1 context or ready to dive in?"

User: "I'm ready. How do we think about shared notes?"

PM: "Great question. Let's explore that with the panels..."
```

### Compounding Knowledge

Each phase builds on previous:

```
Phase 1 Learnings
  ├─ Architecture validated
  ├─ Performance baselines established
  ├─ User preferences identified
  └─ Technical decisions confirmed

Phase 2 Session
  ├─ Builds on Phase 1 architecture
  ├─ Knows what worked and what didn't
  ├─ Avoids re-debating settled questions
  └─ Focuses on team-specific challenges

Phase 2 Implementation
  ├─ Faster because foundation is clear
  ├─ Fewer unknowns
  ├─ Can reuse Phase 1 patterns

Phase 2 Learnings
  ├─ Team collaboration patterns
  ├─ Sync at scale insights
  ├─ New user feedback

Phase 3 Session
  ├─ Builds on Phase 1 + Phase 2
  ├─ Lots of compounded knowledge
  └─ Can focus on enterprise features
```

---

## Context Compression: The Key Innovation

### Why Context Compression Matters

```
WITHOUT COMPRESSION:
Phase 2 session redoes Phase 1 discussion
  - "Let's talk about sync again"
  - "What about authentication?"
  - Hours wasted re-litigating settled questions

WITH COMPRESSION:
Phase 2 session builds on Phase 1 decisions
  - "Phase 1 validated sync. Let's extend it for teams."
  - "Auth from Phase 1. Now add team context."
  - Hours saved by building on prior decisions
```

### Compression Algorithm

```
WHAT GETS COMPRESSED:

1. SETTLED ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS
   Full: [Detailed debate about sync strategy]
   Compressed: "CRDT sync validated in Phase 1"

2. WORKING SOLUTIONS
   Full: [All implementation details]
   Compressed: "Phase 1 deployed successfully with X users"

3. PERFORMANCE BASELINES
   Full: [All performance testing data]
   Compressed: "Phase 1 performs at scale"

4. USER PREFERENCES
   Full: [Detailed QA feedback about UI]
   Compressed: "Users prefer manual sync control"

5. CONSTRAINTS CONFIRMED
   Full: [All Phase 1 constraints discussion]
   Compressed: "Single-user scope was right for Phase 1"

WHAT DOESN'T GET COMPRESSED:

1. OPEN QUESTIONS
   - "What about permissions model?"
   - "How should team sync work?"

2. UNRESOLVED ISSUES
   - "Conflict UI needs clarity"
   - "Search needs special character support"

3. PHASE 2 SPECIFIC CONCERNS
   - "How do we handle concurrent edits?"
   - "What's the team authorization model?"
```

### Example Compression

```
FULL PHASE 1 SESSION (2 hours)
├─ Intake (20 min)
├─ Feature deliberation (30 min)
├─ Architecture deliberation (40 min)
├─ Conflict resolution discussion (20 min)
└─ UX patterns (10 min)

COMPRESSED CONTEXT (3 paragraphs)
"Phase 1 validated the offline-first approach with CRDT sync.
Architecture holds SQLite locally with REST API sync.
Users prefer manual sync triggers. Single-user was correct MVP.
Ready to extend to team collaboration."
```

## Phased vs. Single-Pass: Comparison

### Single-Pass Approach

```
ADVANTAGES:
  ✓ Complete vision up front
  ✓ Can optimize across all phases
  ✓ Single implementation push
  ✓ Fewer roundtable sessions

DISADVANTAGES:
  ✗ Longer before real implementation feedback
  ✗ Larger risk (more assumptions)
  ✗ Longer spec creation (more complex)
  ✗ Can't adjust based on learning

USE WHEN:
  - Vision is completely clear
  - Timeline allows long dev cycle
  - Confident in assumptions
  - All features independent
```

### Phased Approach

```
ADVANTAGES:
  ✓ Faster to first real product
  ✓ Validate assumptions early
  ✓ Adjust future phases based on learning
  ✓ Smaller risk per phase
  ✓ Can ship Phase 1 earlier
  ✓ User feedback from real implementation

DISADVANTAGES:
  ✗ More roundtable sessions
  ✗ More planning overhead
  ✗ Can't optimize globally (phase-by-phase)
  ✗ Later features may need Phase 1 rework

USE WHEN:
  - Vision is broad but unclear
  - Want early market feedback
  - Building incrementally
  - Features build on each other
  - Want to learn before full investment
```

3. Learns from user feedback
4. Feeds learnings to next phase

---

## Best Practices for Phased Development

### Phase Definition

```
✓ GOOD: "Create individual tasks, organize by project"
✗ BAD: "Build the MVP"

✓ GOOD: "Real-time task updates between team members"
✗ BAD: "Make it collaborative"

✓ GOOD: "Task templates to standardize common workflows"
✗ BAD: "Advanced features"

Rule: Each phase should be SPECIFIC and IMPLEMENTABLE
```

### POC (Proof of Concept)

```
✓ GOOD POC: "Offline-first sync that never loses work"
  - Specific technical problem
  - Validates architecture
  - Makes Phase 1 unique

✗ BAD POC: "Basic features"
  - Too vague
  - Not a proof of anything
  - Could be any MVP

✓ GOOD POC: "Real-time updates without conflicts"
  - Specific technical challenge
  - Validates team collaboration approach
  - Makes Phase 2 valuable

Rule: Each phase should PROVE something important
```

### Constraint Clarity

```
✓ GOOD: "Phase 1: No permissions model"
  - User knows it's coming
  - Doesn't try to build it
  - Foundation ready for Phase 2

✗ BAD: "Phase 1: Simple permissions"
  - Ambiguous (what's simple?)
  - User might want more
  - Might block Phase 2 architecture

Rule: Be explicit about what's NOT in each phase
```

---

## Measuring Phase Success

### Per-Phase Metrics

```
TECHNICAL METRICS:
  - Did implementation match spec? (should be near 100%)
  - Were there technical surprises? (should be few)
  - Performance: Did it meet baselines?
  - Test coverage: Did we have confidence to ship?

USER FEEDBACK METRICS:
  - Did users like it? (satisfaction score)
  - What surprised them? (good and bad)
  - What do they want next? (Phase 2 direction)
  - Would they pay for this? (market signal)

BUSINESS METRICS:
  - On time? On budget?
  - Did Phase 1 validate assumptions?
  - Should we refine Phase 1 or proceed to Phase 2?
  - Is the market responding?
```

### Decision Criteria

```
PROCEED TO PHASE 2 IF:
  ✓ Phase 1 implementation matched spec
  ✓ User feedback is positive (>0.7 satisfaction)
  ✓ Architecture validated
  ✓ No critical issues found
  ✓ Ready for next phase direction

REFINE PHASE 1 IF:
  ✓ Critical feedback on core features
  ✓ Architecture issues discovered
  ✓ User experience problems
  ✓ Not ready for next phase dependencies

KILL PROJECT IF:
  ✗ Fundamental assumption wrong
  ✗ Market doesn't want it
  ✗ Technical approach won't scale
  ✗ Business model doesn't work
```

## Integration with Roundtable Features

### Skills System

Each phase uses appropriate skills:

```
Phase 1: Founder skills
  - Individual productivity thinking
  - Web app architecture
  - MVP scope management

Phase 2: Collaboration skills
  - Team dynamics
  - Real-time systems
  - Sharing & permissions

Phase 3: Enterprise skills
  - Workflow automation
  - Compliance
  - Scale operations
```

Skills can be updated based on phase learnings.

### Constitution per Phase

Each phase might use different Constitution:

```
Phase 1: Product-Centric Fast
  - Speed matters
  - MVP thinking
  - Focus on core

Phase 2: Democratic Majority
  - Multiple perspectives matter (team scenarios)
  - Balance concerns
  - Thoughtful design

Phase 3: Security-First Veto
  - Enterprise compliance critical
  - Strong governance needed
  - Careful decisions
```

### Post-Mortem per Phase

After each phase:

```
Post-Mortem Questions:
  - Did this phase succeed?
  - What assumptions were validated/invalidated?
  - What should Phase 2 know?
  - How should skills improve?
  - What patterns emerged?
```

---

## Future Evolution

### V2+: Automated Phase Management

```
VISION:
  Roundtable suggests phases based on vision
  Automatically compresses context between phases
  Predicts Phase N requirements based on Phases 1-N-1
  Learns optimal phase breakdown over time

EXAMPLE:
  User: "I want a note app for teams"
  Roundtable: "I suggest three phases:
    1. Single-user offline-first (foundation)
    2. Real-time team collaboration (POC)
    3. Enterprise permissions (scale)

    Shall we start with Phase 1?"
```

### V3+: Integrated Development

```
VISION:
  Roundtable spec → Developer agents implement →
  QA agents test → Feedback automatically loops back →
  Next phase session starts automatically

CYCLE TIME:
  Today: 2-3 weeks per phase (manual coordination)
  Future: Could be 1 week per phase (automated)
```

---

## Summary: Phased Development Power

Phased development gives you:

1. **Lower Risk** - Validate assumptions early
2. **Faster Feedback** - Real implementation quickly
3. **Incremental Learning** - Each phase informs next
4. **User Engagement** - Test Phase 1, guide Phase 2+
5. **Cost Control** - Can adjust future phases based on Phase 1 ROI
6. **Quality Improvement** - Each phase gets better based on learnings
7. **Market Validation** - Ship Phase 1, get real user signal
8. **Technical Confidence** - Architecture validated before scaling

The key innovation: **Context compression** allows later phases to build on earlier learnings without re-debating settled questions.

This turns Roundtable from a spec-creation tool into a **full product development framework**.
