## ðŸŽ¯ START HERE: Real-World Session Walkthrough

### [USE_CASES_CLI_SESSION.md](USE_CASES_CLI_SESSION.md)
**Complete end-to-end example: myFive dating app vision meeting**

Watch Roundtable in action from start to finish:
- Generic Meeting Facilitator greets user (detects meeting type)
- Facilitator brings in PM to specialize for product vision
- PM introduces process (minimal words)
- User describes vision (myFive dating app: 5-match limit)
- 4 specialist panels form and debate (Product UX, Safety, Technical, Business)
- Panels ask hard questions, identify gaps, pressure-test assumptions
- PM synthesizes learning into Phase 1 development package
- Developers get concrete spec, roadmap, success criteria, and token budget

**Time:** 15-20 minutes to read
**Best for:** Understanding the full meeting flow, seeing how panels work in practice, learning what Phase 1 output looks like

## Documentation Structure

### [USE_CASES_BASIC_FLAT_MODEL.md](USE_CASES_BASIC_FLAT_MODEL.md)
**Original spec validation use cases - the foundation**

These are use cases that work with the basic Roundtable model where multiple models respond to prompts and are synthesized. Useful for understanding:
- How spec iteration works
- How modes (Relevant Order, Moderator, Debate) help refine specs
- How different personas use Roundtable for decision-making

**Key personas:**
- UC-1: Startup Founder (MVP planning)
- UC-2: Enterprise Architect (complex system design)
- UC-3: Solo Developer (feature design iteration)
- UC-4: Product Manager (requirement discovery)
- UC-5: Tech Lead (refactor evaluation)

**Best for:** Understanding basic Roundtable workflows and mode selection

---

### [USE_CASES_SKILLS.md](USE_CASES_SKILLS.md)
**Skills system: Reusable expertise as first-class artifacts**

These use cases showcase how the Skills system (Layer 0) enables flexible expert composition:
- How skills are composed into different configurations
- How skill versioning enables safe evolution
- How skills support team formation and learning

**Key scenarios:**
- UC-S1: Financial Services - Assembling skills from multiple sources (internal, marketplace, open-source)
- UC-S2: Skill Updates - Discovering a new threat and publishing an updated skill version
- UC-S3: Cross-Organization Marketplace - Healthcare compliance skills shared across organizations
- UC-S4: Automatic Team Formation - V2 future where Roundtable learns which skill combinations work best

**Best for:** Understanding how skills enable reusable, versioned, shareable expertise

---

### [USE_CASES_EXPERT_PANELS.md](USE_CASES_EXPERT_PANELS.md)
**Expert panels with multi-agent teams per domain**

These use cases showcase the power of having multiple agents work together as domain experts:
- How panels reach internal consensus
- When and why cross-domain escalations occur
- How within-domain debate produces better decisions than individual agents

**Key scenarios:**
- UC-P1: Financial Services - Security panel (Threat Modeling + Compliance) reaches consensus on authentication
- UC-P2: Startup Product - UX panel (Interaction Design + Accessibility) debates design approach
- UC-P3: Healthcare - Security panel vetoes UX proposal, compromise found

**Best for:** Understanding how domain expertise is leveraged through panel structure

---

### [USE_CASES_CONSTITUTIONS.md](USE_CASES_CONSTITUTIONS.md)
**Pre-defined governance frameworks for different project types**

Constitutions eliminate the "how do we decide?" meta-debate by specifying governance upfront:
- Panel composition per project type
- Consensus algorithms appropriate to context
- Constraints and escalation rules

**Key scenarios:**
- UC-C1: Startup MVP - Product-Centric Fast Constitution (speed matters)
- UC-C2: Healthcare SaaS - Security-First Veto Constitution (compliance is absolute)
- UC-C3: Enterprise Refactor - Democratic Majority Constitution (multiple voices valued)
- UC-C4: Custom Constitution - Policy-Driven organization-specific governance

**Best for:** Understanding how Constitution pre-agreements eliminate deliberation friction

---

### [USE_CASES_CONSENSUS_ALGORITHMS.md](USE_CASES_CONSENSUS_ALGORITHMS.md)
**Different algorithms for different decision contexts**

Same question, different algorithms = different outcomes. Understand when each algorithm is appropriate:
- Democratic Majority (balanced perspectives)
- Security-First Veto (safety-critical decisions)
- Product-Centric Fast (timeline-constrained)
- Comprehensive Synthesis (research/documentation priority)

**Key scenarios:**
- UC-A1: Same question under four different algorithms
- UC-A2: Breaking ties with different algorithms
- UC-A3: Changing algorithms mid-project as context changes

**Best for:** Understanding governance flexibility and trade-offs between different decision-making models
