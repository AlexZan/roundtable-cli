# PMP Analysis: Recommendations Summary

## Executive Summary

Roundtable is **excellent at spec creation and decision-making** but **needs formal PM rigor around scheduling, budgeting, risk, and communications** to become a complete project management framework.

This document summarizes the analysis and proposes specific additions.

---

## Analysis Overview

### What We Analyzed
- 12 existing Roundtable documentation files
- PMBOK Knowledge Areas (10 areas)
- PM Process Groups (5 groups)
- Industry best practices for project management

### Key Finding
Roundtable is strong on **soft skills** (facilitation, learning, stakeholder engagement) but lacks **hard metrics** (schedule, budget, risk, KPIs).

---

## Strengths Identified

### ✅ Excellent Areas (No Action Needed)

| Area | Why Strong |
|------|-----------|
| **Scope Management** | Phase scope is crystal clear. MVP + POC + constraints explicit. |
| **Stakeholder Management** | Project Manager explicitly manages alignment. Five control levels. |
| **Integration Management** | Clear phase transitions. Context compressed between phases. |
| **Quality Management** | Post-mortems drive improvement. QA validates spec. |
| **Learning System** | Skills improve from deliberation. Patterns detected across phases. |

**Recommendation:** Keep these as-is. They're working well.

---

## Gaps Identified

### ⚠️ Partial Coverage (Enhancement Needed)

| Knowledge Area | Current State | What's Missing |
|---|---|---|
| **Time Management** | Examples show 4-week timelines | Dependency analysis, critical path, schedule variance |
| **Cost Management** | Budget estimates in examples | Cost baseline, burn rate tracking, variance analysis |
| **Risk Management** | Risks mentioned ad-hoc | Risk register, probability×impact scoring, response strategies |
| **Communications** | PM facilitates informally | Status plan, decision log, escalation procedures |

### ❌ Missing (Not Covered at All)

| Knowledge Area | Why Missing | When Needed |
|---|---|---|
| **Project Charter** | Roundtable assumes informal startup | Needed for every project for authorization |
| **Change Control** | How do you handle scope changes mid-phase? | Needed when requirements change |
| **Project Plan** | No formal PM planning approach documented | Needed before execution starts |
| **Monitoring Metrics** | No dashboards or health indicators | Needed for active projects |
| **Earned Value** | Not mentioned | Useful for large/complex projects |

---

## Recommendations by Role

### For Project Managers
**Create first:** PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md, MONITORING_AND_CONTROLLING.md
**Why:** These give you the tools to manage
**Time to benefit:** Immediate (can use on next project)

### For Sponsors
**Create first:** PROJECT_CHARTER_AND_INITIATION.md (already done)
**Also create:** MONITORING_AND_CONTROLLING.md
**Why:** See project health, validate success
**Time to benefit:** Before project starts

### For Teams
**Create first:** PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md
**Also create:** CHANGE_MANAGEMENT.md
**Why:** Clear priorities, formal change process
**Time to benefit:** During execution

### For Organization
**Create all:** All Tier 1 documents
**Why:** Establish organizational PM standards
**Time to benefit:** Compound over multiple projects

---

## Conclusion

### Current State
Roundtable is an **excellent deliberation and decision-making system** with superb documentation on facilitation, learning, and phased development.

### Gap Identified
Missing **formal PM rigor** around scheduling, budgeting, risk, and communications that professional project managers expect.

### Solution Proposed
Add 4 essential documents (3 more after charter) that complete the PM framework without changing the underlying excellence of Roundtable's approach.

### Outcome
With recommendations implemented:
- Roundtable becomes a **complete PM framework**
- PMBOK-aligned and industry-standard
- Professional project managers will use it
- Organizations can standardize on Roundtable
- Compounding knowledge system scales across projects

### Next Steps

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ PROJECT_CHARTER_AND_INITIATION.md - CREATED
2. 🔄 Review and provide feedback

**This Week:**
1. Create PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md
2. Create MONITORING_AND_CONTROLLING.md
3. Create PHASE_CLOSURE_AND_LESSONS.md

**This Month:**
1. Create CHANGE_MANAGEMENT.md
2. Create STAKEHOLDER_MANAGEMENT.md (optional)
3. Create RISK_MANAGEMENT.md (optional)

**Result:** Complete, PMBOK-aligned PM framework ready for enterprise adoption.

---

## Questions for Refinement

1. **Priority:** Should we do Tier 2 documents before or after using Tier 1 in practice?

2. **Scope:** Should we create the optional Tier 3 documents (Earned Value, Team Management, Portfolio)?

3. **Implementation:** Should we test these docs with a real Roundtable project first?

4. **Integration:** Are there other PMBOK areas or best practices we should consider?

5. **Customization:** Should we create a "lightweight" PM plan for small projects vs. "comprehensive" for large projects?

---

## Document Overview

**What Exists (from previous analysis):**
- PMP_ANALYSIS.md - Complete gaps and opportunities analysis

**What We Created:**
- PROJECT_CHARTER_AND_INITIATION.md - Formal project startup

**What's Recommended Next:**
1. PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md
2. MONITORING_AND_CONTROLLING.md
3. PHASE_CLOSURE_AND_LESSONS.md
4. CHANGE_MANAGEMENT.md (optional)
5. STAKEHOLDER_MANAGEMENT.md (optional)
6. RISK_MANAGEMENT.md (optional)

**Total new documentation:**
- Tier 1: ~45-50 KB (3 documents)
- Tier 2: ~20-25 KB (3 documents)
- Total: ~65-75 KB of comprehensive PM framework documentation

---

## Summary Statement

**From PMP Perspective:**

Roundtable is exceptionally strong on the creative and collaborative aspects of project management (spec creation, stakeholder alignment, learning), but is weak on the operational and controlling aspects (schedule, budget, risk, metrics).

**The recommendation:** Add 4 essential PM framework documents that provide:

✅ Formal project startup (charter)
✅ Planning rigor (management plan)
✅ Active monitoring (health metrics)
✅ Formal closure (lessons capture)

**Result:** Roundtable becomes a complete, enterprise-ready PM framework that's both creative AND rigorous.

**Timeline:** 8-10 hours to create Tier 1, making Roundtable suitable for professional PM use.

**Status:** Ready to proceed with creating recommended documents.
