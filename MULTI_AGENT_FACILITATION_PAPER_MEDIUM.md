## Abstract

This paper proposes a fundamental shift in how humans interact with AI systems: from single-model conversations to **facilitator-orchestrated multi-agent deliberations**. We argue that complex problems benefit from diverse AI perspectives, and that a facilitator agent can effectively orchestrate conversations between multiple AI models—each contributing domain expertise—to produce richer, more robust solutions. This approach mirrors human expert panels and leverages the natural strengths of different AI models without requiring rigid programmatic orchestration.

**Key Insight:** If a human can interact with an AI model through its interface (API or CLI), then an AI facilitator can interact with other AI agents through those same interfaces. This enables fully agentic orchestration of multi-model conversations.

## 1. Introduction

**1.1 The Current State: Single-Model Interactions**

Today's AI interactions follow a simple pattern: **Human → Single AI Model → Response**

While powerful, this approach has limitations:
- **Narrow perspective:** One model's training, biases, and blindspots
- **Single reasoning style:** One approach to problem-solving
- **Limited expertise breadth:** No model is expert in everything
- **No built-in verification:** Errors and hallucinations go unchallenged

**1.2 The Natural Evolution: Multi-Agent Deliberation**

Human experts solve complex problems through collaboration: **Problem → Panel of Experts → Debate → Consensus → Solution**

**Why not apply this to AI?**

The proposed approach: **Human Topic → AI Facilitator → Multi-Model Panel → Deliberation → Synthesis**

**Benefits:**
- **Diverse perspectives:** Different models, different training, different insights
- **Cross-verification:** Models challenge each other's assumptions
- **Specialized expertise:** Each agent brings domain-specific knowledge
- **Emergent quality:** Collaborative intelligence exceeds individual capability

## 2. The Facilitator Model

**2.1 Core Concept**

**A facilitator agent orchestrates conversations between multiple AI agents.**

**Role of the Facilitator:**
1. **Composition:** Select which agents/experts are needed for a given topic
2. **Orchestration:** Manage conversation flow, turn-taking, context distribution
3. **Synthesis:** Integrate multiple perspectives into coherent insights
4. **Quality Control:** Recognize when discussion has reached resolution or needs more depth

**2.2 Why This Works: Universal Interface Principle**

**Key Observation:** All AI models expose some form of interface:
- HTTP APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI)
- Command-line interfaces (claude-cli)
- SDK bindings (Python, JavaScript libraries)

**Critical Insight:** If a human can send a message and receive a response, so can an agent.

The facilitator connects to multiple models:
- Claude (via Anthropic API or claude-cli subagents)
- GPT-4 (via OpenAI API)
- Gemini (via Google AI API)
- Grok (via xAI API)

From the facilitator's perspective, each agent just needs to:
- Send a message
- Receive a response
- Manage context

**2.3 Fully Agentic Orchestration**

**Our Initial Approach (Programmatic Round-Based):**

In early implementations of Roundtable, we attempted a rigid programmatic approach with predefined control flow and fixed round structures.

**Problems we discovered:**
- Conversations don't follow predictable round structures
- Some topics need deep dives, others need breadth
- Expert needs emerge during discussion, not upfront
- Facilitator couldn't adapt to conversation dynamics
- Human orchestration burden (deciding when to stop, who to add)

**Facilitator Approach (Agentic):**

The facilitator decides:
- Who should speak next?
- What context do they need?
- Should I ask follow-up questions?
- Is the discussion resolved?
- Should I bring in new expertise?

**The facilitator is an agent, not a script.** It makes decisions dynamically based on:
- Conversation quality
- Emerging needs
- Depth of coverage
- Consensus or disagreement signals
- User satisfaction

**2.4 The Facilitator as Improvable Agent**

**Critical insight:** The facilitator itself is an agent with a skill definition, which means:

**It can be improved:**
- Update the facilitator skill to improve orchestration logic
- A/B test different facilitation approaches
- Learn from post-mortem analysis of past sessions

**It can be modified:**
- Different facilitators for different contexts (academic debate vs. brainstorming)
- Specialized facilitators (medical diagnosis, legal research, engineering design)
- User-customized facilitation styles

**It can be shared:**
- Community-developed facilitator skills
- Domain-specific facilitators (e.g., "medical-panel-facilitator")
- Facilitator skill marketplace

**Example facilitator variations:**
- **Socratic facilitator** - asks probing questions, encourages deeper reasoning
- **Consensus facilitator** - identifies common ground, mediates disagreements
- **Devil's advocate facilitator** - challenges assumptions, invites contrarian views

This makes facilitation itself a flexible, evolvable component rather than hardcoded behavior.

## 3. Architecture

**3.1 System Components**

The system has a hierarchical structure:

**At the top:** The user provides a topic

**In the middle:** The Facilitator Agent orchestrates the conversation with these capabilities:
- Select expert panel based on topic
- Spawn/invoke agents as needed
- Manage conversation flow and context
- Synthesize multi-agent responses
- Determine completion criteria

**At the bottom:** Multiple specialized agents:
- Agent 1: Claude with Architecture skill
- Agent 2: GPT-4 with Security skill
- Agent 3: Gemini with UX skill
- Agent N: Grok with Product skill

**3.2 Agent Interfaces**

**For Claude-based agents:**

Native subagent spawning via Task tool allows the facilitator to spawn specialized agents with specific prompts and context.

**For external model agents (GPT-4, Gemini, etc.):**

API-based invocation sends requests with system prompts and messages to external providers.

**Abstraction layer makes them equivalent:**

A unified interface handles both Claude subagents and API calls, making the implementation details invisible to the facilitator.

**3.3 Skills System: Reusable Domain Expertise**

**Skills define domain expertise as reusable components.**

Example: A Software Architecture Expert skill defines:
- ID: architecture
- Name: Software Architecture Expert
- Description: Expert in system design, scalability, distributed systems
- Domain: engineering
- System Prompt: Detailed expertise in architectural patterns, cloud systems, microservices, etc.

**Why skills matter:**
- **Portability:** Same skill can be used with any model
- **Consistency:** Standardized expertise definitions
- **Composability:** Mix and match skills for different panels
- **Versioning:** Skills evolve independently from orchestration logic

**Facilitator uses skills to:**
1. Select appropriate experts for a topic
2. Instantiate agents with domain-specific knowledge
3. Ensure coverage of necessary perspectives

**3.4 Context Curation: The Power of Focused Expertise**

**The Generic LLM Problem:**

All modern LLMs are trained on vast amounts of data covering nearly every domain. This creates a subtle problem:

> General-purpose LLM asked about legal question:
> → Knows law, medicine, engineering, cooking, sports...
> → Attempts to answer everything
> → No focused expertise
> → Reliable, but not specialized

**The Skill-Focused Solution:**

By defining agent skills with clear boundaries and expertise rules, we **curate the context** the LLM operates in.

Example: A Toronto Ontario Legal Expert skill defines:
- Jurisdiction: Toronto, Ontario, Canada
- Expertise: Ontario provincial legislation, Toronto municipal bylaws, Canadian federal law
- Critical rule: If asked about law outside Ontario jurisdiction, defer to appropriate expert

**Why this matters:**

1. **Reliability through focus:** The model's vast knowledge is focused to a specific jurisdiction, making it more reliable as an expert

2. **Defers appropriately:** Generic LLMs try to answer everything. Skill-focused agents know when to defer:
   > "I can propose the architecture, but the Security expert should validate the cryptographic approach and access controls."

3. **Context curation:** Even though the LLM "knows" about California law, Toronto law, UK law, the skill definition **curates its context** to Toronto/Ontario, making it function as a true specialist

4. **Panel composition works:** When agents defer appropriately, the facilitator knows when to bring in additional expertise

**Real-world example:**

Roundtable on: "Legal compliance for Toronto tech startup"

Panel:
- Toronto Legal Expert (focused: Ontario/Toronto jurisdiction)
- Privacy Expert (focused: PIPEDA, Canadian privacy law)
- Employment Law Expert (focused: Ontario employment standards)

> **Toronto Legal:** "For your incorporation, you'll follow Ontario Business Corporations Act. Privacy Expert should address data handling."
>
> **Privacy Expert:** "Under PIPEDA, you need... [detailed requirements]"
>
> **Employment Law:** "For hiring, Ontario Employment Standards Act requires..."

**Each agent stays in their lane** because their skill definition explicitly teaches them:
- What their expertise covers
- When to defer to other experts
- The value of depth over breadth

**This is counterintuitive:** We're taking a model trained on everything and **deliberately constraining** it. But this constraint is what makes multi-agent panels work—without it, every agent tries to answer everything, and you lose the benefit of diverse expertise.

**Note:** A future paper will explore context curation and conversational flow management in depth.

## 4. Conversation Patterns

**4.1 Basic Deliberation Flow**

**User asks:** "Design a secure authentication system for my web app"

**Facilitator analyzes topic**
- Identifies needed expertise: Architecture, Security, UX
- Selects models: Claude (Architecture), GPT-4 (Security), Gemini (UX)
- Spawns/prepares 3 agents

**Round 1: Initial Perspectives**
- Facilitator → Architecture: "Propose an auth system design"
- Facilitator → Security: "Identify security requirements"
- Facilitator → UX: "Consider user experience implications"

**Round 2: Cross-Examination**
- Facilitator → Security: "Review Architecture's proposal"
- Facilitator → Architecture: "Address Security's concerns"
- Facilitator → UX: "How does this impact users?"

**Round 3: Convergence**
- Facilitator → All: "Propose integrated solution"
- Facilitator analyzes responses

**Synthesis**
- Facilitator: "Here's the consensus design with tradeoffs explained"

**4.2 Dynamic Panel Expansion**

**Agents can recommend additional expertise:**

> **Round 2:**
> **Security Agent:** "I recommend bringing in a Privacy expert to review GDPR compliance"
>
> **Facilitator decides:** "Good point, adding Privacy expert"
> → Spawns Privacy agent (Grok with privacy skill)
> → Asks: "Review this design for GDPR compliance"
>
> **Round 3 now includes Privacy perspective**

**4.3 Skill-to-Skill Deep Dives**

**When specific cross-domain questions arise:**

Architecture Agent mentions: "Rate limiting at API gateway"

Facilitator notices security implication:
- Asks Security Agent: "Evaluate the rate limiting approach for DDoS protection"
- Gets targeted response
- Relays back to Architecture Agent: "Security recommends..."
- Architecture adjusts design

**4.4 Completion Detection**

**Facilitator determines when discussion has reached sufficient depth.**

**Signals that discussion is complete:**
- ✓ All agents have contributed perspectives
- ✓ Major disagreements have been addressed
- ✓ Consensus on approach has emerged
- ✓ Implementation details are sufficiently detailed
- ✓ Risks and tradeoffs are documented

**Signals that more rounds needed:**
- ✗ Unresolved disagreements between agents
- ✗ New concerns raised in latest round
- ✗ Missing critical perspective identified
- ✗ Insufficient detail for implementation
- ✗ User explicitly requests more depth

**4.5 Human Participation in Panels**

**Humans can participate as panel members alongside AI agents.**

**Key principle: Agent-blind participation**

Panel composition:
- Architecture (Claude Sonnet 4)
- Security (GPT-4 Turbo)
- Compliance Expert (Human: Sarah Chen)
- UX (Gemini 2.0)

**Critical design choice:** AI agents are **not informed** that one participant is human.

**Why agent-blind?**

1. **Eliminates deference bias:** If agents know a human is present, they may defer inappropriately: ❌ "As a human expert, your judgment on this is superior to mine..." vs. ✓ "I disagree with the compliance assessment because..."

2. **Maintains peer dynamics:** All participants are treated as equal experts contributing domain knowledge

3. **Authentic deliberation:** Agents engage with human contributions the same way they engage with other agents—critically, analytically, respectfully

4. **Prevents authority anchoring:** Humans don't become automatic "tie-breakers" whose opinion ends discussion

**Benefits:**
- **Human expertise on tap:** Bring in human judgment for high-stakes decisions
- **Hybrid intelligence:** Combine AI breadth with human depth
- **Domain knowledge injection:** Human can contribute specialized expertise not in any training data
- **Real-time correction:** Human can spot and correct agent errors during deliberation
- **Trust building:** Users see AI agents critically engaging with human contributions

**Use cases:**
- Medical diagnosis (doctor participates in AI panel)
- Legal analysis (lawyer contributes jurisdiction-specific knowledge)
- Engineering design (senior engineer provides constraints and requirements)
- Academic research (domain expert guides literature interpretation)

**4.6 Conversation Branching and Iteration**

**Roundtable sessions support branching and replay from any point in the conversation.**

**The problem:** Sometimes after a discussion concludes, new information emerges or a flaw is spotted.

**Traditional approach:**
> Discussion complete → Flaw found → Start over from scratch
> → Lose all previous context and good ideas

**Roundtable branching:**
> Discussion complete → Flaw found → Branch from problematic point
> → Preserve earlier good work
> → Explore alternative path
> → Compare outcomes

**How it works:**

Every roundtable session is a **conversation tree**, not a linear sequence:

> Session Start
> ↓
> Round 1: Initial proposals
> ↓
> Round 2: Security review
> ↓
> Round 3: Integration discussion
> ├─→ Branch A (original): Consensus reached ✓
> │
> └─→ Branch B (new info): "Wait, we forgot GDPR requirements"
>       ↓
>     Round 3B: Privacy expert added
>       ↓
>     Round 4B: Revised design with GDPR compliance

**Benefits:**
- **Iterative refinement:** Improve decisions without starting over
- **Exploration:** Try different approaches, compare outcomes
- **Learning:** See how different expertise changes conclusions
- **Auditability:** Full tree of explored alternatives preserved
- **Efficiency:** Reuse earlier good work, only redo flawed reasoning

**Use cases:**
- Post-launch retrospective: "What if we'd considered X earlier?"
- Risk exploration: "What if requirements change in this way?"
- Sensitivity analysis: "How does conclusion change with different expert?"
- Error correction: "Spotted mistake at Round 5, branch back to Round 3"

**4.7 Post-Mortem Analysis and Self-Learning**

**After a roundtable session, specialized agents can review what went right and wrong.**

**Post-mortem agent evaluates:**
- Did the panel have appropriate expertise?
- Were there gaps in knowledge or perspective?
- Did agents defer appropriately to other experts?
- Was the facilitator effective in orchestration?
- Did discussion reach sufficient depth?
- Were there missed opportunities or blind spots?

**Self-learning workflow:**

1. Roundtable session completes
2. Post-mortem agent reviews transcript
3. Generates analysis (what worked, what failed, missing expertise)
4. Produces recommendations (skill improvements, panel changes, facilitator updates)
5. Human or agent applies improvements
6. Future sessions benefit from learnings

**Continuous improvement cycle:**

> Run Roundtable Session
> ↓
> Post-Mortem Analysis
> ↓
> Generate Recommendations
> ↓
> Human or Agent Applies Changes
> ↓
> (Improved for next session)

**Benefits:**
- **Self-improving system:** Gets better with every session
- **Knowledge capture:** Learnings from one session benefit all future sessions
- **Quality assurance:** Systematic review catches patterns humans might miss
- **Skill evolution:** Skills improve based on real-world performance

## 5. Why This Represents the Future

**5.1 Natural Problem-Solving Pattern**

**Human experts naturally form panels for complex problems:**
- Academic peer review
- Medical second opinions
- Architecture review boards
- Security audits
- Product design critiques

**Why limit AI to solo performance when collaboration is demonstrably better?**

**5.2 Model Diversity as Feature**

**Different AI models have different strengths:**
- Claude: Long context, nuanced reasoning, tool use
- GPT-4: Broad knowledge, creative problem-solving
- Gemini: Multimodal understanding, fast inference
- Grok: Real-time information, Twitter/X integration

**Rather than choosing one model, leverage all of them.**

**5.3 Emergent Intelligence**

**Multi-agent deliberation produces emergent properties:**
- **Error correction:** Models catch each other's mistakes
- **Bias mitigation:** Diverse training reduces individual biases
- **Perspective synthesis:** Combined insights exceed individual capability
- **Confidence calibration:** Agreement signals reliability, disagreement signals uncertainty

**5.4 Scalable Expertise**

**Skills as composable units enable:**
- **Rapid panel assembly:** Mix and match for any domain
- **Expertise evolution:** Update skills independently
- **Community contributions:** Shared skill libraries
- **Specialization depth:** Narrow, deep expertise alongside broad knowledge

**5.5 Transparency and Trust**

**Users can observe the deliberation process:**
- See different perspectives explicitly
- Understand reasoning from multiple angles
- Identify when consensus exists vs. legitimate disagreement
- Trust multi-model agreement more than single-model output

## 6. Implementation Patterns

**6.1 Minimal Viable Architecture**

**Start simple, validate the concept:**

The basic setup includes:
1. A facilitator skill (Claude agent with orchestration capabilities)
2. An agent roster (multiple models with specific skills)
3. Orchestration logic (facilitator manages the conversation)

**Facilitator's internal logic (agentic, not programmatic):**
1. Analyze topic
2. Select agents (or validate provided agents)
3. For each round:
   - Decide who speaks next
   - Provide appropriate context
   - Collect response
   - Assess conversation state
4. When complete, synthesize insights
5. Return to user

**6.2 Progressive Enhancement**

**Phase 1: Basic Multi-Agent Conversation**
- Facilitator orchestrates predefined panel
- Sequential turn-taking
- Fixed number of rounds
- Manual synthesis

**Phase 2: Dynamic Orchestration**
- Facilitator dynamically selects panel from topic analysis
- Adaptive turn-taking (facilitator decides who speaks)
- Dynamic completion (facilitator decides when done)
- Automated synthesis

**Phase 3: Emergent Collaboration**
- Agents recommend additional expertise
- Skill-to-skill direct questioning
- Sub-panel formation for deep dives
- Confidence scoring and consensus detection

**Phase 4: Learning and Optimization**
- Facilitator learns from past sessions
- Skill effectiveness tracking
- Panel composition optimization
- User preference learning

**6.3 Integration Patterns**

**CLI Application:**

> $ roundtable "Design a secure auth system"
> Facilitator: Assembling panel...
>   - Architecture (Claude Sonnet 4)
>   - Security (GPT-4 Turbo)
>   - UX (Gemini 2.0)
>
> Round 1: Initial perspectives...
> [Architecture]: I propose a JWT-based approach...
> [Security]: We need to consider token storage...
> [UX]: Users should have passwordless options...
>
> Round 2: Integration...

**API Service:**

POST request to /api/v1/deliberate with topic, facilitator model, and agent specifications. Returns session ID, conversation rounds, synthesis, and consensus level.

**Library/SDK:**

Python library provides Facilitator and Panel classes for programmatic access to multi-agent deliberation.

## 7. Challenges and Considerations

**7.1 Cost and Latency**

**Challenge:** Multiple models = multiple API calls = higher cost and slower responses

**Mitigation strategies:**
1. **Smart agent selection:** Only invoke necessary experts
2. **Parallel execution:** When agents don't need each other's context
3. **Model tier selection:** Use cheaper models (Haiku, GPT-4-mini) when appropriate
4. **Caching:** Reuse context and system prompts
5. **Progressive disclosure:** Start with small panel, expand only if needed

**Cost example:**
- Single GPT-4 call: $0.01 per conversation
- 3-agent panel (3 rounds): ~$0.10 per conversation
- **Value proposition:** 10x cost for significantly higher quality and verification

**7.2 Context Management**

**Challenge:** Maintaining coherent context across multiple agents

**Solutions:**
1. **Facilitator as context hub:** Central point manages conversation history
2. **Selective context:** Agents receive only relevant portions
3. **Skill-specific context:** Architecture agents see architecture discussions, etc.
4. **Summarization:** Facilitator summarizes previous rounds for efficiency

**7.3 Quality Control**

**Challenge:** Preventing low-quality or off-topic responses

**Solutions:**
1. **Facilitator screening:** Reviews responses before sharing with panel
2. **Relevance scoring:** Agents must stay on topic
3. **Confidence signals:** Agents express uncertainty explicitly
4. **User feedback loop:** Users can redirect or request clarification

**7.4 Convergence**

**Challenge:** Ensuring deliberation reaches actionable conclusions

**Solutions:**
1. **Explicit completion criteria:** Facilitator checks for resolution signals
2. **Maximum rounds:** Prevent infinite discussions
3. **Synthesis forcing:** Facilitator must produce synthesis regardless of consensus
4. **Disagreement documentation:** When consensus fails, document the tradeoffs

- Specialist 2 (Gemini): Neurology expertise
- Radiologist (Grok): Imaging interpretation
- Pharmacologist (Human: Dr. Martinez): Drug interaction analysis

**Deliberation example:**

> Patient presents: Chest pain, dizziness, cognitive fog
>
> **Round 1: Initial assessment**
> **Primary Care:** "Symptoms suggest cardiovascular, but neurological component concerning. Need cardiology and neurology consult."
>
> **Cardiology:** "EKG shows mild arrhythmia, but doesn't fully explain symptoms. Need to rule out neurological causes."
>
> **Neurology:** "Cognitive symptoms + dizziness could indicate TIA or vestibular issue. MRI recommended."
>
> **Round 2: Imaging review**
> **Radiologist:** "MRI shows no acute stroke, but small vessel disease noted. Could explain cognitive symptoms."
>
> **Cardiology:** "In context of small vessel disease, arrhythmia more significant. May be causing microemboli."
>
> **Round 3: Treatment planning**
> **Pharmacologist (Human):** "Patient's current medications include [X, Y]. Anticoagulation proposed, but contraindicated with X. Suggest alternative approach..."
>
> **Synthesis:** Multi-factorial diagnosis with coordinated treatment plan

**Outcome:**
- Comprehensive diagnosis considering all specialties
- Drug interactions caught that single specialist might miss
- Treatment plan addressing cardiovascular + neurological components

- **Differential diagnosis** explored systematically
- **Human expert integration** for high-stakes medication decisions
- **Second opinions** built into process

**Critical note:** Medical roundtables are **decision support**, not replacement for human physicians. Final diagnosis and treatment remain with human medical professional.

**8.7 Scribe Agents: Domain-Specific Documentation**

**After deliberation, specialized scribe agents can generate documentation in appropriate formats.**

**The problem:** Different contexts require different documentation styles:
- Scientific papers need rigorous methodology and citations
- Legal briefs require specific formatting and precedent references
- Business proposals need executive summaries and financial projections
- Technical specs need precise terminology and diagrams

**Solution: Scribe agents with format-specific skills**

Example scribe specializations:
- **Scientific paper scribe** - Academic writing conventions, citation management, methodology documentation
- **Legal brief scribe** - Legal citation, precedent integration, argument structure
- **Technical specification scribe** - API documentation, architecture diagrams, code examples

**How it works:**

1. Roundtable session completes
2. User requests documentation: "Generate a technical spec from this discussion"
3. Facilitator selects appropriate scribe (Technical Spec Scribe)
4. Scribe reviews full transcript
5. Generates formatted documentation with proper structure, citations, diagrams
6. Output delivered in target format

**Example: Multiple output formats from same roundtable**

Roundtable topic: "Design authentication system for web app"

**Documentation requests:**

**1. "Technical spec for engineering team"**
Technical Scribe produces: Architecture diagrams, API endpoint definitions, security requirements, implementation guide, testing checklist

**2. "Executive summary for leadership"**
Business Scribe produces: 1-page overview, cost/timeline estimates, risk assessment, business impact, resource requirements

**3. "Security assessment for compliance"**
Legal Scribe produces: Compliance checklist (GDPR, SOC2), risk mitigation documentation, audit trail, policy recommendations, regulatory references

**Benefits:**
- **Format expertise:** Each scribe knows domain conventions
- **Reusable insights:** Same deliberation → multiple document types
- **Audience-appropriate:** Automatically tailored to reader expertise
- **Quality assurance:** Scribes ensure documentation meets standards
- **Efficiency:** No manual transcription or reformatting

## 11. Ethical Considerations

**11.1 Transparency**

**Obligation:** Users should understand they're interacting with multiple AI models

**Implementation:**
- Clear disclosure of panel composition
- Attribution of responses to specific agents
- Explanation of facilitator's decision-making

**11.2 Bias Amplification vs. Mitigation**

**Risk:** Multiple models could reinforce shared biases

**Mitigation:**
- Diverse model selection (different training data, organizations)
- Explicit bias-checking agents when appropriate
- User awareness of potential bias sources

**11.3 Responsibility and Accountability**

**Question:** Who is responsible when multi-agent system gives bad advice?

**Considerations:**
- Facilitator model provider?
- Individual agent model providers?
- Application developer?
- User for following advice?

**Best practice:** Clear disclaimers, audit trails, human oversight for high-stakes decisions

**11.4 Cost Accessibility**

**Risk:** Multi-model conversations are more expensive than single-model

**Mitigation:**
- Tiered service levels (1-agent, 3-agent, 5-agent options)
- Open-source facilitator implementations
- Local model support for cost-sensitive use cases

## 12. Conclusion

**12.1 Summary**

**Multi-agent facilitation represents a paradigm shift in human-AI interaction:**

1. **From solo to collaborative AI:** Multiple models working together produce better outcomes than any single model alone

2. **From programmatic to agentic orchestration:** A facilitator agent dynamically manages conversations rather than rigid scripts

3. **From black-box to transparent deliberation:** Users observe the reasoning process from multiple perspectives

4. **From one-size-fits-all to specialized panels:** Domain expertise assembled on-demand for each problem

**12.2 Key Principles**

**The Universal Interface Principle:**
> If a human can interact with an AI through its interface (API, CLI), then an AI facilitator can interact with other AIs through those same interfaces.

**The Facilitator Principle:**
> Complex conversations need orchestration. A dedicated facilitator agent can manage multi-model deliberations more effectively than programmatic control flow.

**The Skills Principle:**
> Domain expertise should be defined as reusable, model-agnostic components that can be applied to any AI model.

**The Emergence Principle:**
> The quality of multi-agent deliberation exceeds the sum of individual agent capabilities through cross-verification, perspective diversity, and collaborative synthesis.

**12.3 The Future**

**We envision a future where:**

- **Default AI interaction is multi-model:** Just as we consult multiple human experts for important decisions, we'll consult multiple AI models for complex problems

- **Facilitator agents are ubiquitous:** Specialized in orchestration, these agents become essential infrastructure for AI-powered applications

- **Skills marketplaces emerge:** Communities develop and share expertise definitions, creating rich ecosystems of reusable AI capabilities

- **Hybrid human-AI panels:** Seamless integration of human experts into AI panels, combining human judgment with AI analysis

- **Continuous learning systems:** Facilitators and agents improve through experience, learning which panel compositions and conversation patterns work best

**12.4 Call to Action**

**For researchers:**
- Study facilitator optimization and panel composition strategies
- Develop metrics for multi-agent conversation quality
- Investigate consensus mechanisms and disagreement handling

**For developers:**
- Build facilitator agent implementations
- Create skill libraries for different domains
- Develop user interfaces for multi-agent interactions

**For AI providers:**

## 13. Appendix: Roundtable Project

**13.1 Project Overview**

**Roundtable** is an open-source implementation of the multi-agent facilitation model described in this paper.

**Repository:** https://github.com/AlexZan/roundtable-cli

**Key Features:**
- Facilitator-orchestrated multi-model conversations
- Skills-based expertise system
- Support for Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, and Grok
- CLI and API interfaces
- Session persistence and replay

**13.2 Technical Architecture**

**Core Components:**
1. **Meeting Facilitator:** Claude-based agent that orchestrates conversations
2. **Skills Library:** YAML-defined domain expertise (architecture, security, UX, product, etc.)
3. **Agent Factory:** Creates agents from skills and model selections
4. **Model Registry:** Unified interface to multiple AI providers
5. **Session Manager:** Persists and manages conversation state

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Skills system implemented
- ✅ Multi-model support (4 providers)
- ✅ Panel composition logic
- 🚧 **In progress:** Refactoring from programmatic to agentic orchestration
- 🔜 **Planned:** Dynamic panel expansion, skill-to-skill querying, consensus detection

**13.3 Example Session**

> $ npm run dev
>
> Welcome to Roundtable CLI
>
> **Topic:** Design a secure authentication system for a web application
>
> **Facilitator:** Analyzing topic and composing panel...
>
> **Panel Composition:**
>   - Architecture (Claude Sonnet 4)
>   - Security (GPT-4 Turbo)
>   - UX (Gemini 2.0)
>
> Starting deliberation...
>
> **[Round 1]**
>
> **Facilitator → Architecture:** Please propose an authentication system design
>
> **Architecture (Claude Sonnet 4):**
> I recommend a layered approach:
> 1. JWT-based token authentication for API access
> 2. Refresh token rotation for extended sessions
> 3. OAuth 2.0 integration for social login
> ...
>
> **Facilitator → Security:** Review the architecture proposal and identify concerns
>
> **Security (GPT-4 Turbo):**
> The JWT approach is solid, but I have concerns:
> 1. Token storage: Where are tokens stored on client?
> 2. XSS protection: How do we prevent token theft?
> 3. CSRF: Need explicit protection mechanisms
> ...
>
> **Facilitator → UX:** Consider the user experience implications
>
> **UX (Gemini 2.0):**
> From a UX perspective:
> 1. Offer passwordless options (magic links, passkeys)
> 2. Clear session management UI
> 3. Biometric options for mobile
> ...
>
> **[Round 2]**
>
> **Facilitator → Architecture:** Address Security's concerns
>
> **Architecture:**
> Incorporating security feedback:
> 1. HttpOnly cookies for token storage (prevents XSS)
> 2. SameSite=Strict for CSRF protection
> 3. Short-lived access tokens (15 min), secure refresh
> ...
>
> **[Round 3 - Synthesis]**
>
> **Facilitator:** Consensus reached. Synthesizing recommendations...
>
> **Final Design:**
> - Authentication: JWT with refresh token rotation
> - Storage: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict cookies
> - Session: 15-minute access tokens, 7-day refresh tokens
> - Social login: OAuth 2.0 (Google, GitHub)
> - Passwordless: Magic links + Passkey support
> - Mobile: Biometric authentication
> - Security: Rate limiting, CAPTCHA, audit logging
>
> **Trade-offs:**
> - Cookie-based approach limits cross-domain usage
> - Short token lifetime may impact offline functionality
> - Passwordless options require email reliability
>
> **Implementation priority:**
> 1. Core JWT + refresh token system
> 2. Social OAuth integration
> 3. Passwordless options
> 4. Biometric support
>
> Session saved. Token usage: 12,450 tokens across 3 models.
