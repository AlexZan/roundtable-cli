```
✅ Scope Management
   - Phase scope is crystal clear (MVP + POC + constraints)
   - Zero ambiguity on what's in vs. out of scope

✅ Stakeholder Management
   - Project Manager explicitly manages alignment
   - Five control levels accommodate all stakeholder types
   - Engagement strategies vary by involvement level

✅ Integration Management
   - Clear phase transitions
   - Context compressed between phases
   - No information loss between handoffs

✅ Quality Management
   - Post-mortems drive continuous improvement
   - QA validates implementation against spec
   - Skills improve from each deliberation

✅ Learning System (Unique to Roundtable)
   - Each phase creates organizational knowledge
   - Patterns detected across multiple projects
   - Skill improvement is systematic
```

**Recommendation for these areas:** Keep as-is. They're working exceptionally well.

### Gaps: What's Missing for PMBOK Alignment

```
❌ GAP 1: Project Charter
   Current: Sessions start without formal authorization
   Missing: Vision, success criteria, authority, scope, budget
   Impact: No formal kickoff, unclear objectives

❌ GAP 2: Schedule Management
   Current: "Phase 1 takes 4 weeks"
   Missing: Dependency analysis, critical path, schedule variance tracking
   Impact: Can't identify delays early, can't optimize schedule

❌ GAP 3: Cost Management
   Current: "Budget is $20-25K"
   Missing: Cost baseline, budget variance tracking, burn rate
   Impact: Can't track budget health or make investment decisions

❌ GAP 4: Risk Management
   Current: Risks mentioned ad-hoc
   Missing: Risk register, probability×impact scoring, response strategies
   Impact: Risks not prioritized or formally managed

❌ GAP 5: Communications Plan
   Current: PM facilitates informally
   Missing: Status cadence, decision log, escalation procedures
   Impact: Miscommunication, no audit trail

❌ GAP 6: Change Control
   Current: Not documented how changes are handled
   Missing: Change request process, impact analysis, approval workflow
   Impact: Scope creep, missed timelines, budget overruns

❌ GAP 7: Monitoring & Controlling
   Current: Ad-hoc tracking
   Missing: KPIs, earned value, performance indices
   Impact: No objective project health visibility

❌ GAP 8: Phase Closure
   Current: Informal closure
   Missing: Closure checklist, formal acceptance, lessons template
   Impact: Inconsistent learning capture across projects
```

## Risk of Not Making Changes

**If we don't add these documents:**

```
Risk 1: Enterprise Won't Adopt
  "Roundtable is great for specs but not real PM"
  Impact: Adoption limited to startups/small projects

Risk 2: Projects Fail Silently
  "We don't know if we're on track or not"
  Impact: Surprises at phase gates, last-minute crises

Risk 3: Budget Overruns
  "Budget is ad-hoc, no variance tracking"
  Impact: Finance can't forecast, projects overspend

Risk 4: Scope Creep
  "No formal change control"
  Impact: Projects balloon, timelines slip

Risk 5: Knowledge Lost
  "Learning not systematic"
  Impact: Same mistakes repeated across projects
```

---

## Benefits of Making Recommendations

**If we create recommended documents:**

```
Benefit 1: Enterprise Adoption
  PMBOK-aligned, professional PM framework
  Impact: Used by organizations at scale

Benefit 2: Project Visibility
  Real-time KPIs and health tracking
  Impact: Issues caught early, resolved before escalation

Benefit 3: Budget Confidence
  Detailed tracking and variance analysis
  Impact: Finance knows project health, can forecast

Benefit 4: Scope Management
  Formal change control with impact analysis
  Impact: Informed decisions on scope changes

Benefit 5: Organizational Learning
  Systematic lessons capture
  Impact: Organization learns from every project
```

## Questions for Reflection

Before proceeding, consider:

1. **Priority:** Should we complete all Tier 1 documents before using them in a real project, or test them in parallel?

2. **Adaptation:** Should we create "lightweight" versions for small projects vs. "comprehensive" for large projects?

3. **Integration:** How should these new documents integrate with existing Roundtable documentation?

4. **Customization:** Should organizations be able to customize charter/plan templates for their context?

5. **Automation:** Should we create templates and forms (not just documentation)?

---

## Summary: PMP Perspective

### What Roundtable Achieves Well
- Exceptional at spec creation through deliberation
- Excellent at stakeholder alignment
- Outstanding continuous learning system
- Clear phase structure and scope management

### What Roundtable Needs
- Formal PM rigor around scheduling and budgeting
- Systematic risk management
- Objective project health metrics
- Formal communications and change control

### How to Get There
- Create 4 essential PM documents (8-10 hours)
- Add 3 optional documents (7 hours)
- Result: Complete, PMBOK-aligned PM framework

### Timeline
- Essential docs: 1-2 weeks
- Full suite: 3-4 weeks
- Ready for enterprise use: Immediately after Tier 1

### Why It Matters
With these additions, Roundtable goes from "great tool for spec creation" to "complete project development framework" that organizations can standardize on.

🎯 **Outcome:** Complete, enterprise-ready PM framework

---

## Final Note

The PMP analysis reveals that Roundtable has built something exceptional: a **learning system wrapped in a decision framework**. The gaps aren't in the core innovation; they're in the operational rigor that enterprises expect.

Adding formal PM structure doesn't diminish Roundtable's creative strength—it amplifies it by making the results measurable, trackable, and repeatable.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with creating Tier 1 documents. The investment (8-10 hours) is small relative to the value unlock (enterprise adoption and organizational scaling).
