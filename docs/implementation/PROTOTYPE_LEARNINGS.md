## Architecture Validation

### ✅ What Worked Well

**TypeScript + Node.js:**
- [ ] Fast iteration with `tsx` for development
- [ ] Type safety caught errors early
- [ ] Async/await for parallel API calls worked smoothly

**Claude API Integration:**
- [ ] API responses were fast (~3-5s per agent)
- [ ] Token tracking accurate and helpful
- [ ] Error handling sufficient for prototype

**CLI Experience:**
- [ ] Inquirer prompts felt natural
- [ ] Output formatting clear and readable
- [ ] Session persistence worked reliably

**Debate Engine:**
- [ ] Agents did debate (not just agree) - OR agents mostly agreed
- [ ] Round 2 showed agents responding to each other
- [ ] Parallel execution worked correctly

### ⚠️ Issues Encountered

**Technical Issues:**
- [ ] [List any errors, API failures, or bugs]

**Debate Quality:**
- [ ] [Did agents truly debate or just restate positions?]
- [ ] [Was Round 2 meaningfully different from Round 1?]
- [ ] [Did agents reference each other's points?]

**User Experience:**
- [ ] [Any confusion in CLI flow?]
- [ ] [Was output too verbose or too terse?]
- [ ] [Any missing features that felt critical?]

## Key Findings

### 1. Multi-Agent Debate Effectiveness

**Observation:**
- [ ] Agents naturally debated different perspectives - OR -
- [ ] Agents tended to agree too easily - OR -
- [ ] Agents talked past each other without engaging

**Example from Session [#]:**
```
Round 1 - Architecture: [Summary of position]
Round 1 - Product: [Summary of position]

Round 2 - Architecture: [How did they respond to Product's view?]
Round 2 - Product: [How did they respond to Architecture's view?]
```

**Conclusion:** [Does the multi-agent approach add value?]

### 2. Round Flow Validation

**Observation:**
- [ ] Round 1 → Round 2 context worked as expected
- [ ] Agents clearly saw and responded to each other in Round 2
- [ ] 2 rounds felt sufficient for basic debate - OR -
- [ ] More rounds would be valuable

**Conclusion:** [Is 2 rounds the right number?]

### 3. Token Economics

**Observation:**
- Average tokens per session: [X]
- Cost per session: $[Y]
- Most tokens used by: [Round 1 / Round 2 / Context]

**Conclusion:** [Are costs reasonable for production use?]

### 4. Session Persistence

**Observation:**
- [ ] JSON files saved correctly
- [ ] Sessions could be loaded and listed
- [ ] File size: [X KB per session]

**Conclusion:** [Is JSON sufficient or do we need a database?]

## Recommendations for Phase 1B

### Must Have (Critical for Phase 1 completion)
- [ ] [Feature/change needed]
- [ ] [Feature/change needed]
- [ ] [Feature/change needed]

### Should Have (Important but not blocking)
- [ ] [Feature/change needed]
- [ ] [Feature/change needed]

### Nice to Have (Can defer to Phase 2)
- [ ] [Feature/change needed]
- [ ] [Feature/change needed]

## Enhanced Debate Mechanics (V1.1) - When to Add?

Based on prototype testing:

**Recommendation:** [ ] Phase 1B / [ ] Phase 2 / [ ] Phase 3

**Reasoning:**
- Evidence tagging would be [valuable now / premature / overkill because...]
- Convergence metrics would [help / complicate / not be needed because...]
- Post-mortem learning should [start now / wait for more data because...]

---

## Multimodal Support (V1.2) - When to Add?

Based on prototype testing:

**Recommendation:** [ ] Phase 1B / [ ] Phase 2 / [ ] Phase 3

**Reasoning:**
- Image support would [unlock key use cases / be nice but not critical]
- Text-only is [sufficient for now / limiting because...]
- Priority order: [Images → Audio → Documents / different order because...]

---

## Changes to Implementation Plan

### Adjust Phase 1 Scope
- [ ] Expand to include: [features]
- [ ] Remove from Phase 1: [features]
- [ ] Keep as planned

### Adjust Token Estimates
- [ ] Phase 1 estimate was accurate (~35K tokens)
- [ ] Increase estimate to: [X tokens] because [reason]
- [ ] Decrease estimate to: [X tokens] because [reason]

### Adjust Timeline
- [ ] 1 week timeline was realistic
- [ ] Increase to: [X weeks] because [reason]
- [ ] Can accelerate to: [X days] because [reason]
