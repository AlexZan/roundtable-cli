# Agentic Execution Plan: Operational Framework for Agent-Driven Phases

## Overview

An **Agentic Execution Plan** is how human stakeholders specify *what* they want agents to accomplish, and agents determine *how* to accomplish it within defined constraints.

Unlike traditional project plans (which specify sequencing, resource allocation, and scheduling), agentic execution plans specify:
- **Vision**: What success looks like (human-defined)
- **Constraints**: What's in/out of scope (human-defined)
- **Token budget**: Computational resources available (human-defined)
- **Quality standards**: How to validate completeness (human-defined)
- **Learning objectives**: What skills to develop (human-defined)

Agents then use full autonomy to execute within these constraints.

---

## Why Execution Plans Matter for Agentic Systems

### Traditional Project Plans Solve These Problems
```
✅ Prevent over-commitment (schedule realistic deliverables)
✅ Allocate resources efficiently (assign tasks to people)
✅ Reduce uncertainty (plan dependencies)
✅ Enable coordination (task sequencing)
✅ Track progress (compare actual vs. planned)
```

### Agentic Execution Plans Solve Different Problems
```
✅ Prevent scope creep (define what agents should focus on)
✅ Allocate computational budgets (ensure sufficient tokens)
✅ Reduce token waste (efficient agent coordination)
✅ Enable parallel work (agents work simultaneously by default)
✅ Validate quality (agents meet standards, not timelines)
```

## Core Components of an Agentic Execution Plan

### 1. Vision Charter (Human Input)

The Vision Charter captures what humans want agents to accomplish. It's the **intent specification**.

```markdown
VISION CHARTER

Project: [Project Name]
Sponsor: [Human Decision-Maker]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## SECTION 1: Project Vision

Describe in 2-3 sentences what success looks like:
- What problem are we solving?
- What outcome do we want?
- Why does this matter?

Example:
"Build a real-time analytics dashboard for customer retention metrics.
Success = Dashboard shows 3 key metrics updated hourly, accurate to ±2%,
accessible to 50+ marketing users simultaneously."

---

## SECTION 2: Success Criteria

List 5-7 measurable criteria agents must satisfy:

1. [MUST]: Accuracy ≥ 95% on test dataset
2. [MUST]: Response time < 2 seconds for 99th percentile
3. [SHOULD]: Support 100+ concurrent users
4. [SHOULD]: Work with data refreshed ≤ 1 hour ago
5. [NICE]: Provide drill-down analysis on any metric
6. [NICE]: Mobile-responsive interface

---

## SECTION 3: Out of Scope

Explicitly state what agents should NOT do:

- Do not modify production data
- Do not change authentication system
- Do not create new data pipelines (reuse existing)
- Do not redesign the underlying database

---

## SECTION 4: Constraints & Assumptions

Specify hard constraints:

- Must use existing Postgres database
- Must integrate with current Okta authentication
- Must run on existing AWS infrastructure
- Agents can assume 3-month historical data available
- Agents can assume data quality is ≥ 90%

---

## SECTION 5: Stakeholders & Approval

Who validates completion?

- **Data accuracy**: Analytics Lead (≥95% validation)
- **Performance**: DevOps Engineer (load testing)
- **UX**: Product Manager (usability review)
- **Final acceptance**: VP of Marketing
```

---

```

### 3. Cost Model: Tokens + Human Hours + Infrastructure

**Critical Standard: All project costs are calculated as THREE components, NOT traditional developer teams.**

Unlike traditional software development (hiring dev teams, project managers, QA engineers), agentic projects use:

```markdown
COST MODEL FOR AGENTIC PROJECTS

COMPONENT 1: Agent Tokens
  - Tokens = computational work done by AI agents
  - $0.008-0.03 per token depending on model
  - Example: 48,000 tokens @ $0.01/token = $480
  - NEVER estimate agent work in time (weeks, days, hours)

COMPONENT 2: Human Oversight Hours
  - Human time for planning, QA validation, decision-making
  - NOT full-time developers (estimated in hours, not months)
  - $25-100/hour depending on role
  - Example: 15 hours @ $50/hour = $750
  - Includes: Architecture review, QA sign-off, deployment oversight

COMPONENT 3: Infrastructure Costs
  - Cloud services, databases, third-party APIs
  - Estimated separately from agent work
  - Example: $2,000 for AWS, Redis, verification service
  - Same as traditional projects but typically LOWER due to simpler deployment

TOTAL PROJECT COST = Token Cost + Human Hours + Infrastructure

Example: MVP Dating App (Phase 1)
  Agent tokens:        48,000 @ $0.01/token  = $480
  Human oversight:     15 hours @ $50/hour   = $750
  Infrastructure:      AWS + services        = $2,000
  ────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL PHASE 1:                            = $3,230

COMPARISON: Traditional Dev Team for Same Project
  2 engineers × 12 weeks @ $150/hour:      = $72,000
  1 PM × 12 weeks @ $120/hour:             = $7,200
  Infrastructure:                          = $2,000
  ────────────────────────────────────────────
  TOTAL (Traditional):                     = $81,200

SAVINGS: $78,000 (96% reduction)

---

CRITICAL RULES:
✅ Always express agent work in tokens, NEVER in time
✅ Always estimate human hours for oversight separately
✅ Never confuse tokens with hours (1 token ≠ 1 minute)
✅ Always include infrastructure costs separately
✅ Always compare to traditional dev team costs for context
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Traditional time-based estimates don't apply to agents
- Agents work in parallel (no "full-time equivalent" concept)
- Token budgets are computational resources, not scheduling
- Human oversight is minimal (10-30% of traditional PM overhead)
- Cost savings come from NO salaries/benefits for 90% of work

---

### 4. Phase Structure with Quality Gates

Agentic Execution Plans define discrete phases separated by quality gates.

```markdown
PHASE STRUCTURE & QUALITY GATES

PHASE 1: DISCOVERY & REQUIREMENTS (16,500 tokens)

Inputs:
  - Vision Charter (from Vision section above)
  - Existing dashboard examples

  Decision Rule:
    IF all criteria checked → PROCEED to Phase 2
    IF issues found → ITERATE Phase 1 (max 5,000 additional tokens)
    IF cannot resolve → ESCALATE to sponsor

Context Compression After Phase 1:
  - Archive: Raw stakeholder feedback, intermediate notes

  ☐ Security review completed (data protection, authentication)
  ☐ Scalability plan validated (supports 100+ users)

  Decision Rule:
    IF all criteria checked → PROCEED to Phase 3

  Decision Rule:
    IF all criteria checked → PROCEED to Phase 4
    IF performance issues → FIX in Phase 3 (max 8,000 additional tokens)
    IF major issues → ITERATE to Phase 2 design (escalate)

Context Compression After Phase 3:
  - Archive: Intermediate code versions, build artifacts
  - Retain: Final code, test results, deployment checklist

  ☐ Response time < 2 seconds (99th percentile)
  ☐ Concurrent user test passed (100 users)
  ☐ All MUST-have requirements met
  ☐ ≥80% of SHOULD-have requirements met
  ☐ Sponsor explicitly approves proceeding

  Decision Rule:
    IF all MUST criteria met AND sponsor approves → PROCEED to Phase 5
    IF some MUST criteria failed → FIX in Phase 3 extension (escalate)
    IF too many SHOULD items missing → NEGOTIATE with sponsor

Context Compression After Phase 4:
  - Archive: Test results, intermediate findings

    ✅ Learning captured for organizational growth
    ✅ Token budget utilized efficiently (target: 90K total actual vs 200K available)
```

---

### 5. Agent Coordination & Handoffs

How agents hand off work between phases.

```markdown
AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOL

Three Types of Handoffs:

1. PARALLEL HANDOFF (Within Same Phase)

   Example: Phase 1 - Agent 1 and Agent 2 work simultaneously

   Timeline:
   - T=0: Both agents start with Vision Charter
   - T=4 days: Agent 1 completes Requirements Document (10K tokens used)
   - T=4 days: Agent 2 completes Data Dictionary (6.5K tokens used)
   - T=4 days: Both outputs available to Phase 2 agents

   Coordination:
   - No dependency (agents work independently)
   - Both outputs are validated independently
   - Phase 2 receives both completed documents
   - Total elapsed time: 4 days (not 8)

2. SEQUENTIAL HANDOFF (Phase-to-Phase)

   Example: Phase 1 completion → Phase 2 start

   Timeline:
   - Day 2: Phase 1 Quality Gate validation occurs
   - Day 2 (EOD): Decision made (all criteria met → proceed)
   - Day 3: Phase 2 agents receive compressed context
   - Day 3: Phase 2 agents begin work

   Handoff Package Contents:
   - Finalized requirements document (8K tokens)
   - Data dictionary with refresh rates
   - Approved architecture options
   - Decision log explaining choices
   - Constraints and assumptions

   Context Compression:
   - Original Phase 1 output: 30K tokens
   - Compressed: 8K tokens
   - Compression ratio: 3.75:1
   - Rule: Retain decisions, archive supporting details

3. CONDITIONAL HANDOFF (Branching Logic)

   Example: Phase 4 Quality Gate triggers different paths

   If Quality Gate 4 Passes:
   → Proceed to Phase 5 (Learning & Handoff)
   → Then: Production deployment

   If Quality Gate 4 Fails on Performance:
   → Escalate to sponsor with options:
      a) Iterate Phase 3 with additional 8K tokens
      b) Reduce success criteria (negotiate with stakeholder)
      c) Extend Phase 4 testing with additional scenarios

   If Quality Gate 4 Fails on Requirements Coverage:
   → Return to Phase 2 design (escalate - design was incomplete)
   → Re-estimate token budget (add 10-15K tokens)

---

HANDOFF CHECKLIST

Before Phase N agents complete and hand off to Phase N+1:

☐ All Quality Gate N criteria explicitly validated (YES/NO for each)
☐ Stakeholder sign-off obtained (if required)
☐ Context compression performed (original → compressed token count documented)
☐ Decision log attached (why choices were made)
☐ Issues/escalations identified and flagged
☐ Next phase input package prepared
☐ Learning observations documented (even if minor)
☐ Handoff approval from Phase Lead
```

---

### 6. Parallel Execution Strategy

How to maximize parallel work across agents.

```markdown
PARALLEL EXECUTION STRATEGY

Key Principle: Minimize dependencies between agents within and across phases.

DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS

Phase 1: 2 agents, NO dependencies
├─ Agent 1: Requirements ─────────┐
└─ Agent 2: Data Architecture ────┤ (Both complete Day 2, independent)
   Result: Parallel execution, 2 agents × 4 days = 8 agent-days, 4 calendar days

Phase 2: 2 agents, DEPENDS on Phase 1
├─ Agent 3: UI/UX Design (depends on Requirements)
└─ Agent 4: Backend Design (depends on Data Architecture)
   Start: Day 3 (when Phase 1 complete)
   Result: Parallel execution, 2 agents × 2 days = 4 agent-days, 2 calendar days

Phase 3: 2 agents, DEPENDS on Phase 2
├─ Agent 5: Backend Implementation (depends on Backend Design)
└─ Agent 6: Frontend Implementation (depends on UI/UX Design)
   Start: Day 5 (when Phase 2 complete)
   Result: Parallel execution, 2 agents × 4 days = 8 agent-days, 4 calendar days

Phase 4: 1 agent (QA), DEPENDS on Phase 3
└─ Agent 7: QA & Testing
   Start: Day 9 (when Phase 3 complete)
   Result: Sequential, 1 agent × 2 days, 2 calendar days

Phase 5: 1 agent (Learning), DEPENDS on Phase 4
└─ Agent 8: Learning Capture
   Start: Day 11 (when Phase 4 complete)
   Result: Sequential, 1 agent × 1 day, 1 calendar days

TOTAL PROJECT DURATION: 11 calendar days
WITHOUT PARALLELIZATION: 5 phases × 2 days avg = 10 calendar days
PARALLELIZATION BENEFIT: 11 vs 10 = slight improvement (phases already short)

BUT: Token efficiency improved significantly:
  - Parallel total: 73,500 tokens used across all phases
  - Allows 126,500 token reserve for unknown issues
```

### 7. Learning Objectives

What specific skills should agents develop during execution.

```markdown
LEARNING OBJECTIVES

Learning Objective 1: Analytics Dashboard Best Practices
├─ Skill: What makes dashboards effective for power users?
├─ Evidence: Design decisions in Phase 2 (UI/UX spec)
├─ Measurement: Did Phase 2 design reflect best practices?
├─ Application: Next analytics project can reference this

Learning Objective 2: Performance Optimization at Scale
├─ Skill: How to optimize query performance for 100+ concurrent users?
├─ Evidence: Architecture decisions and test results (Phase 3-4)
├─ Measurement: Did we achieve < 2 sec response time?
├─ Application: Next high-scale project can reuse patterns

Learning Objective 3: Data Quality Assessment
├─ Skill: How to evaluate data quality and document assumptions?
├─ Evidence: Data Dictionary and quality assessment (Phase 1)
├─ Measurement: Did data quality assumptions prove accurate?
├─ Application: Next project with similar data sources

Learning Objective 4: Stakeholder Requirements Elicitation
├─ Skill: How to translate vague stakeholder needs into precise specs?
├─ Evidence: Requirements document quality (Phase 1)
├─ Measurement: How many requirement changes post-handoff? (should be <10%)
├─ Application: Next requirements phase can use similar patterns

---

LEARNING CAPTURE TEMPLATE

After Phase N completion, document learning as:

LEARNING ENTRY

Phase: [Phase number]
Topic: [What was learned]
Context: [Where this happened]
Evidence: [What shows this was learned]
Generalization: [How does this apply to other projects?]

Example:
─────────

Phase: 2 (Design)
Topic: Dashboard information density affects power user engagement
Context: During UI/UX design, agent tested 3 layouts
Evidence: High-information-density layout (all metrics on one page) scored 92%
         in stakeholder preference vs. low-density (85%)
Generalization: For power user dashboards, prioritize information density over
               simplicity. Simplify only for consumer-facing dashboards.
Application: Next financial analytics dashboard should follow high-density
            pattern (with proper hierarchy/filtering)
```

## Status & Usage

**Agentic Execution Plan** is a template for planning agent-driven projects following the principles in AGENTIC_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md.

**Use when:** Starting any agent-driven project phase
**Precedes:** Actual agent work in that phase
**Followed by:** AGENTIC_QUALITY_VALIDATION.md (quality gate validation)

**Key Difference from Traditional Plans:**
- Specifies constraints and intent, not implementation details
- Token budgets, not time budgets
- Quality metrics, not schedule metrics
- Agents choose HOW; humans choose WHAT

**Integration Points:**
- Feeds into PHASED_DEVELOPMENT.md (phase structure)
- Uses token budget framework from CLAUDE.md
- Implements quality gates from AGENTIC_PROJECT_MANAGEMENT.md
- Learning loop integrates with POST_MORTEM_SYSTEM.md
