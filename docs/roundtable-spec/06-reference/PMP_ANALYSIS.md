### Knowledge Areas We Partially Cover

#### ⚠️ Time Management (Partial)
- **What we have:**
  - PHASED_DEVELOPMENT.md: Example 4-week Phase 1

            Week 2: Sync (depends on database schema)
            Week 3: Search (depends on data model)
            Week 4: Polish

            Critical path: Sync system (determines when Phase 2 can start)
            Slack: Search polish could slip without impacting Phase 2"
  ```

#### ⚠️ Cost Management (Partial)
- **What we have:**
  - Examples with budget estimates ($20K, $35K)
  - Cost awareness in use cases

- **What's missing:**
  - No formal cost estimation process
  - No resource allocation methodology

            Infrastructure: $3K
            Testing: $2K
            Contingency (20%): $5K
            Total: $25K

            Budget baseline: $25K
            Variance tracking: Monitor spend vs baseline
            ROI: Phase 1 cost vs Phase 2+ revenue"
  ```

#### ⚠️ Risk Management (Partial)
- **What we have:**
  - PHASED_DEVELOPMENT.md mentions "lower risk"

  - No risk response strategies
  - No contingency planning
  - No risk monitoring process

- **Example gap:**
  ```
  We show: "SQLite might not scale at 100K notes"
  Missing: "Risk ID: R-001
            Description: SQLite reaches limits at 100K+ notes
            Probability: Medium (60%)
            Impact: High (Phase 2 rework)
            Risk Score: 0.60 × 0.9 = 0.54

            Response: Mitigate through Phase 1 testing at 100K
            Owner: Architecture Expert

            - Weekly status: What was decided this week
            - Stakeholder reports: Customized by audience
            - Risk escalation: Issues that block progress
            - Change log: Decisions made and why
            - Decision record: Architecture choices documented"
  ```

### Knowledge Areas We Don't Cover

#### ❌ Procurement Management
- **Why missing:** Roundtable is internal decision framework, not procurement
- **Could add:** If using external vendors for implementation
- **When relevant:** Phase involves contracting developers, platforms, etc.

#### ❌ Human Resource Management
- **Why missing:** Focus is on AI agents, not HR
- **Could add:** Team structure, roles, assignments for developer team
- **When relevant:** Managing human developers, QA teams, etc.

#### ❌ Portfolio Management
- **Why missing:** Roundtable is single-project focused
- **Could add:** How multiple Roundtable projects interact
- **When relevant:** Organization running multiple products

## Current Strengths from PM Perspective

### 1. Explicit Scope Management
```
✅ STRENGTH: Phase-by-phase scope is crystal clear
   - MVP defined (what IS in scope)
   - POC defined (what's being proven)
   - Constraints defined (what's NOT in scope)

   IMPACT: Prevents scope creep, enables prioritization
```

### 2. Continuous Learning & Improvement
```
✅ STRENGTH: Post-mortem system drives continuous improvement
   - Each phase generates learnings
   - Skills improve from deliberation
   - Patterns detected across phases

   IMPACT: Project gets smarter over time
```

### 3. Stakeholder Alignment
```
✅ STRENGTH: Project Manager explicitly manages stakeholder understanding
   - Intake phase aligns on vision
   - Deliberation surface conflicts (resolved)
   - Multiple control levels accommodate different stakeholders

   IMPACT: Fewer surprises, better decisions
```

### 4. Clear Phase Transitions
```
✅ STRENGTH: Context compression ensures knowledge carries forward
   - Phase 1 learnings → Phase 2 context
   - Feedback → Next phase input
   - Skills improve → Better deliberation

   IMPACT: Each phase is faster and better informed
```

### 5. Quality Through Validation
```
✅ STRENGTH: QA testing and feedback loop validates against spec
   - Implementation tested against spec
   - Issues identified early
   - Feedback informs product direction

   IMPACT: Quality built in, not added on
```

---

## Current Weaknesses from PM Perspective

### 1. No Formal Schedule Management
```
❌ WEAKNESS: Missing dependency analysis and critical path

   Current state: "Phase 1 takes 4 weeks"

   Should add:
   - Week 1 depends on: Auth design
   - Week 2 depends on: Week 1 completion + Database schema
   - Week 3 depends on: Sync system from Week 2
   - Week 4 depends on: Weeks 1-3
   - Critical path: Sync system determines Phase 2 start
   - Slack: Search could slip 3 days without impact

   Impact: Can't do earned value, can't identify delays early
```

### 2. No Formal Cost Management
```
❌ WEAKNESS: Budget tracking not formalized

   Current state: "Estimate $20-25K"

   Should add:
   - Detailed cost breakdown by resource type
   - Cost baseline for variance tracking
   - Budget contingency reserve
   - Burn rate monitoring
   - ROI analysis

   Impact: Can't track budget health, can't make investment decisions
```

### 3. No Risk Management Framework
```
❌ WEAKNESS: Risks identified ad-hoc, no formal assessment

   Current state: "SQLite might not scale" (mentioned in PHASED_DEVELOPMENT)

   Should add:
   - Risk register: All identified risks with metadata
   - Risk assessment: Probability × Impact scoring
   - Response strategies: Mitigate, accept, avoid, transfer
   - Owner assignment: Who monitors each risk?
   - Trigger conditions: What indicates risk is happening?

   Impact: Can't prioritize risk response, can't track risk mitigation
```

### 4. No Formal Communications Plan
```
❌ WEAKNESS: Communication happens ad-hoc, no structured approach

   Current state: Project Manager facilitates, implicit communication

   Should add:
   - Status reporting cadence and audience
   - Decision log with rationale
   - Escalation procedures
   - Stakeholder communication matrix
   - Change request process

   Impact: Miscommunication, no documented rationale for decisions
```

### 5. No Formal Project Charter or High-Level Plan
```
❌ WEAKNESS: No document kickoff or authorization

   Current state: First Roundtable session starts without formal charter

   Should add:
   - Project charter: Vision, objectives, success criteria
   - Preliminary project scope: Phase breakdown
   - High-level timeline: When each phase starts/ends
   - Budget envelope: Total project investment
   - Authorization: Who approved this project?

   Impact: No official initiation, unclear authority, vague objectives
```

### 6. No Formal Change Management
```
❌ WEAKNESS: How do you change direction mid-phase?

   Current state: Not documented

   Should add:
   - Change request process
   - Impact analysis: How does change affect scope/time/cost?
   - Approval process: Who decides on changes?
   - Implementation: How to incorporate into active phase

   Impact: Scope creep, missed deadlines, budget overruns
```

## Summary: PMP Perspective

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Strong on scope management and specification
- ✅ Excellent on stakeholder alignment and communication
- ✅ Great continuous improvement framework
- ✅ Clear phase transitions

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Missing formal schedule/timeline management
- ❌ Missing formal cost/budget management
- ❌ Missing formal risk management
- ❌ Missing formal project charter
- ❌ Missing formal communications plan
- ❌ Missing formal change control process
- ❌ Missing metrics and KPIs for health tracking

**Opportunity:**
Add 4 essential documents to complete PM framework:
1. PROJECT_CHARTER_AND_INITIATION.md
2. PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md
3. MONITORING_AND_CONTROLLING.md
4. PHASE_CLOSURE_AND_LESSONS.md

These four documents transform Roundtable from a great deliberation tool into a **complete project management framework** aligned with PMBOK standards.

**Bottom line:** Roundtable is excellent at spec creation and decision-making, but needs formal PM rigor around scheduling, budgeting, risk, and communications to be a complete PM solution.
