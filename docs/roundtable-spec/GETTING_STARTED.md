# Getting Started with Roundtable: Documentation Guide

Welcome! This guide helps you navigate the Roundtable documentation based on what you want to understand.

---

## üöÄ For First-Time Users: Start Here

### Step 1: Understand the Vision (15 minutes)

**Document:** [00-core/VISION_AND_PHILOSOPHY.md](00-core/VISION_AND_PHILOSOPHY.md)

**What you'll learn:**
- Why Roundtable exists
- The meeting room paradigm
- How human creativity is amplified by AI
- The shift from "build fast" to "spec right"

**Key takeaway:** Roundtable helps you go from vague vision to complete spec through structured dialogue with expert panels.

### Step 2: See It In Action (20 minutes)

**Start here - complete walkthrough:**
- **[05-use-cases/CLI_SESSION.md](05-use-cases/CLI_SESSION.md)** - Real session: myFive dating app vision meeting
  - See: Meeting Facilitator detects meeting type ‚Üí brings in PM ‚Üí panels form ‚Üí debates happen ‚Üí Phase 1 package created
  - Best way to understand the full flow in 20 minutes
  - **Demonstrates:** Parallel round-based debate, token-based budgeting, spec emergence

**Then choose role-specific examples:**
- **For Founders:** [05-use-cases/BASIC_FLAT_MODEL.md](05-use-cases/BASIC_FLAT_MODEL.md) - UC-1 "Startup Founder"
- **For Architects:** [05-use-cases/EXPERT_PANELS.md](05-use-cases/EXPERT_PANELS.md) - UC-P1 "Financial Services Security"
- **For Product Teams:** [05-use-cases/CONSTITUTIONS.md](05-use-cases/CONSTITUTIONS.md) - UC-C1 "Startup MVP"

**Key takeaway:** See how vague ideas become concrete development packages through structured panel deliberation.

### Step 3: Understand How It Works (20 minutes)

**Documents (pick based on your role):**

- **How specs emerge:** [03-spec-process/ITERATIVE_SPEC_EMERGENCE.md](03-spec-process/ITERATIVE_SPEC_EMERGENCE.md)
  - How panels deliberate and decisions emerge
  - Why this is better than pre-writing specs

- **How the PM orchestrates:** [01-agents/PROJECT_MANAGER_AGENT.md](01-agents/PROJECT_MANAGER_AGENT.md)
  - The Project Manager's role in orchestrating sessions
  - How context is managed and conflicts resolved

- **Your level of involvement:** [00-core/USER_INTERACTION_CONTROL.md](00-core/USER_INTERACTION_CONTROL.md)
  - Choose how hands-on you want to be
  - From fully automated to co-creation

**Key takeaway:** Understand the mechanics of how a Roundtable session works.

### Step 4: Run Your First Session (30-60 minutes)

**Document:** [00-core/SPEC.md](00-core/SPEC.md) - Section 8 "User Workflows"

Follow the workflow for your use case:
- New idea: "From Vague Idea to Spec"
- Testing decision: "Testing Architectural Decision"

## üìö For Deep Understanding: Core Concepts

### The Four-Layer Architecture

```
Layer 0: SKILLS (01-agents/SKILLS.md)
‚îÇ        Reusable expertise definitions
‚îÇ
Layer 1: CONSTITUTION (04-governance/CONSTITUTIONS.md)
‚îÇ        Governance frameworks that reference skills
‚îÇ
Layer 2: EXPERT PANELS (00-core/EXPERT_PANELS.md)
‚îÇ        Multi-agent domain teams using skills
‚îÇ
Layer 3: DELIBERATION ENGINE (00-core/SPEC.md)
‚îÇ        Orchestrates panels and manages consensus
```

### The Complete Session Flow

```
1. INTAKE PHASE
   Meeting Facilitator detects meeting type
   Project Manager understands your vision
   ‚Üí See: 01-agents/PROJECT_MANAGER_AGENT.md

2. PANEL FORMATION
   Panels selected based on vision type
   Agents assigned to panels
   ‚Üí See: 00-core/EXPERT_PANELS.md

3. ROUND-BASED DEBATE
   Round 1: All agents speak in parallel
   Facilitator synthesizes groups concerns
   User responds
   Round 2+: Agents address each other naturally
   ‚Üí See: 00-core/CONSENSUS_ALGORITHMS.md

4. SPEC EMERGENCE
   Panels deliberate and spec grows organically
   ‚Üí See: 03-spec-process/ITERATIVE_SPEC_EMERGENCE.md

5. CONVERGENCE
   Conflicts resolved, decisions finalized
   Consensus algorithms apply
   ‚Üí See: 00-core/CONSENSUS_ALGORITHMS.md

6. POST-MORTEM
   Learning captured, skills improved for future
   ‚Üí See: 03-spec-process/POST_MORTEM_SYSTEM.md
```

### Token-Based Project Management

**Critical: All estimates use TOKENS, never human time**

```
Token Budget = Computational Work by AI Agents
Human Hours = Separate estimate for planning/QA oversight
Infrastructure = Cloud services, databases, APIs

Example: MVP Project
  48,000 tokens @ $0.01/token = $480
  15 hours @ $50/hour         = $750
  AWS infrastructure          = $2,000
  ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ
  TOTAL:                      = $3,230

vs. Traditional Dev Team: $50K+
```
