COMMONS CLAUSE LICENSE CONDITION v1.0

Based on the Commons Clause standard (https://commonsclause.com/)

The Software is provided to you by the Licensor under the License, as defined
above, subject to the following condition.

No Commercial Rebranding Without License

The following restriction applies to the Software:

You may not offer the Software, or any modified version of the Software, for
"Sell," as that term is defined below, without first obtaining a separate
commercial license from the Licensor.

DEFINITION OF "SELL"

"Sell" means to offer the Software as part of a commercial product or service,
or to offer the functionality of the Software in a commercial capacity, where
the primary value delivered to customers derives, entirely or substantially,
from the functionality of the Software. This includes, but is not limited to:

1. Integrating the Software into a commercial product or service and charging
   for access to that product or service
2. Offering the Software as a cloud service, managed service, or SaaS platform
3. Selling a product or service whose core value is substantially derived from
   the Software
4. Reselling or redistributing the Software or its modified versions for
   commercial gain
5. Offering services that depend on the Software as their primary offering

EXCEPTIONS (No License Required)

The following uses are explicitly allowed without a commercial license:

1. Non-commercial use of the Software for personal projects, research, or
   academic purposes
2. Using the Software as an internal tool to support your organization's own
   operations (not as a service offered to others)
3. Integrating the Software into a larger product where the Software's
   functionality is NOT the primary value (i.e., it's one feature among many,
   and users are not primarily purchasing your product for the Software's
   functionality)
4. Modifying or extending the Software for your own internal use
5. Contributing improvements back to the open-source project
6. Using the Software in open-source projects (where the open-source license
   applies)

OBTAINING A COMMERCIAL LICENSE

If you wish to use the Software in a way that requires a commercial license,
you must:

1. Contact the Licensor at: licensing@roundtable.ai
2. Negotiate a commercial license agreement with terms suitable to your use
3. Execute a Commercial License Agreement with the Licensor
4. Pay any required licensing fees as specified in your agreement

Upon execution of a valid Commercial License Agreement, you will have the right
to use the Software in the manner described in that agreement, subject to its
terms and conditions.

ENFORCEMENT

If you use the Software in a manner that violates this Commons Clause (i.e.,
you "Sell" the Software without a commercial license), the Licensor may:

1. Require you to cease the infringing activity
2. Demand payment of reasonable licensing fees for past use
3. Seek injunctive relief and monetary damages in court
4. Recover reasonable attorneys' fees and costs

MODIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION

This Commons Clause applies to any modified versions of the Software, as long
as those modifications remain substantially the same Software (rather than being
entirely rewritten).

This Commons Clause does not apply to:
- Work that is entirely independent and not derived from the Software
- Software that reimplements the functionality of the Software but uses
  completely different code and architecture
- Use of the Software under a valid Commercial License Agreement

INTERPRETATION

In case of any ambiguity between the MIT License and the Commons Clause, the
more restrictive interpretation shall apply. The intent of these licenses is to:

1. Protect open-source use and community contribution
2. Protect the Licensor's ability to commercialize the Software
3. Ensure fair compensation when the Software is integrated into commercial
   products

If you have questions about whether your intended use requires a commercial
license, please contact: licensing@roundtable.ai
