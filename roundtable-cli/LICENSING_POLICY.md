## Understanding the License Terms

### What Does "Sell" Mean?

Under the Commons Clause, you cannot "Sell" the Software without a commercial
license. "Sell" means:

**You need a license if:**

- ✅ Your product's primary value comes from Roundtable
- ✅ Customers are paying for a service based on Roundtable
- ✅ You integrate Roundtable and charge for the combined product
- ✅ You offer Roundtable functionality via a SaaS platform
- ✅ You're reselling or repackaging Roundtable

**You DON'T need a license if:**

- ✅ Using Roundtable internally (not selling it)
- ✅ Using Roundtable as one component in a larger system
- ✅ Roundtable is NOT the primary value (one feature among many)
- ✅ Using in open-source projects
- ✅ Non-commercial use
- ✅ Internal business operations

### Example: Does Your Use Case Need a Commercial License?

```

**Scenario 2: Company Using Roundtable Internally**
```

External product: Not selling it
Decision: NO LICENSE NEEDED - Use MIT ✅
Cost: FREE

**Scenario 3: SaaS Platform**
```

## Obtaining a Commercial License

### Step 1: Determine Your Needs

Before contacting us, prepare:

- What are you building?
- How will Roundtable be integrated?
- How many users/customers?
- What's your revenue model?
- When do you need to go live?

### Step 2: Contact Licensor

**Email:** licensing@roundtable.ai

**Include in your email:**
- Company name and website
- Your name and title
- Brief description of your product
- How Roundtable will be used
- Expected scale (users, API calls, etc.)

**Example email:**

```
Subject: Roundtable Commercial License Request - Cursor IDE

Hi,

We're Cursor, an AI-powered IDE. We'd like to integrate the Roundtable
multi-agent debate engine as a new feature. Our current user base is 500K
developers, and we expect 20% to use the Roundtable feature.

We're looking to launch in Q1 2025.

Can we schedule a call to discuss licensing terms?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Step 3: Negotiation

We'll discuss:

- Integration scope and complexity
- Scale of integration (users, deployments, etc.)
- Revenue model (how you're making money)
- Support requirements
- Timeline and milestones

Typical license models:

1. **Flat Fee:** $X per year (most common)
2. **Per-User:** $X per user per month
3. **Usage-Based:** $X per API call or deliberation
4. **Revenue Share:** X% of revenue from feature

### Step 4: Agreement Execution

We'll provide:

1. **Commercial License Agreement** (see [COMMERCIAL_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md](./COMMERCIAL_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.md))
2. **Statement of Work** (specific to your integration)
3. **Payment terms** (invoice, net 30 days, etc.)

You'll sign and we'll email you a copy.

### Step 5: Integration

Once license is executed:

- You have legal permission to integrate
- Get priority support for technical questions
- Access to any updates or improvements
- Optional: Quarterly technical reviews

## FAQ

### Q: Can I use Roundtable in my for-profit company?

**A:** Yes, but depends on how:

- **Internal use (no license needed):** You use Roundtable to improve your internal
  processes. That's fine under MIT.
- **Selling Roundtable (license needed):** You integrate Roundtable into a product
  you sell. You'll need a commercial license.

### Q: Can I fork Roundtable and build my own version?

**A:** Yes, completely fine:

- You can fork the repository
- Modify and customize it for your needs
- Use your fork freely
- BUT: If you sell the fork, you're still "selling" something derived from
  Roundtable (might need license - contact us to clarify)

### Q: What if I can't afford a commercial license?

**A:** Talk to us. Options include:

- **Startup pricing:** Reduced fees for early-stage companies
- **Usage-based pricing:** Only pay for what you use
- **Flexible terms:** Multi-year discounts or deferred payment
- **Open sourcing:** Consider open-sourcing your integration

Email: licensing@roundtable.ai

### Q: What happens if I don't get a license but should have?

**A:** We prefer not to litigate. If we find unlicensed commercial use:

1. We'll send you a friendly email
2. Give you 30 days to discuss or get a license
3. If no response: Cease-and-desist letter
4. If still no response: Legal action

Most companies get a license once they understand the issue. It's much better
than litigation.

### Q: Can I resell or sublicense?

**A:** Only with written permission. Standard commercial license does NOT include:

- Sublicensing to third parties
- Reselling to your customers
- Integrating into white-label products

These require special agreements. Email licensing@roundtable.ai to discuss.

### Q: What about updates and new versions?

**A:** Under commercial license:

- You get all updates to current major version
- Security patches always free
- Major version upgrades might require renewal
- We'll notify you 60 days before new versions

### Q: Can I keep using the old MIT version forever?

**A:** Yes:

- The MIT license never expires
- You can always use the version under MIT you downloaded
- But you won't get updates beyond that
- For ongoing updates, consider commercial license

### Q: How do you handle startups vs enterprises?

**A:** Flexible pricing:

- **Early-stage startups:** Often can negotiate lower fees or usage-based pricing
- **Larger companies:** Flat annual fees or revenue share
- **Non-profit:** May qualify for free license (discuss with us)

Email licensing@roundtable.ai with your situation.

### Q: What if I integrate Roundtable but it's just one small feature?

**A:** If Roundtable IS the primary value customers pay for, you need a license.

If it's one feature among many and customers aren't primarily paying for it,
you might not need one, but **ask us first**.

Email: licensing@roundtable.ai with details

**Better safe than sorry.**
